<h2>FAMILIAR TALK WITH THE READER.<br />
————————</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I should</span> be indeed flattered could I believe that you
hail with as much pleasure as I do the renewal of the
“Common-Sense Talks,” to which I first invited you
four years ago. For I have much to say to you in the
same free-masonic, free-and-easy strain in which you
indulged me then.</p>

<p>It is a wild March night. Winter and Summer,
Spring-time and Autumn, the wind sings, or plains at
my sitting-room window. To-night its shout is less
fierce than jocund to my ear, for it says, between the
castanet passages of hail and sleet, that neither friend
nor bore will interrupt our conference. Shutters and
curtains are closed; the room is still, bright, and
warm, and we are no longer strangers.</p>

<p>The poorest man of my acquaintance counts his
money by the million, has a superb mansion he calls
“home,” a wife and beautiful children who call him
“husband” and “father.” He has friends by the
score, and admirers by the hundred, for human nature
has not abated one jot in prudential sycophancy since
the Psalmist summed up a volume of satirical truth
in the pretended “aside”—“and men will praise thee
when thou doest well unto thyself.” For all that, he
of whom I write is a pauper, inasmuch as he makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
his boast that he never experienced the emotion of
gratitude. He has worked his own way in the world,
he is wont to say: has never had helping hand from
mortal man or woman. It is a part of his religion to
pay for all he gets, and never to ask a favor. Nevertheless,
he confesses, with a complacent smirk that
would be amusing were it not so pitiable an exhibition
of his real beggary—“that he would like to know what
it feels like to be grateful,—just for the sake of the
novel sensation!”</p>

<p>Poor wretch! I am sorry I introduced him here and
now. There is a savage growl in the wind; our snuggery
is a trifle less pleasant since I began to talk of
him. Although I only used him as a means of “leading
up” to the expression of my own exceeding and
abundant wealth of gratitude to you, dear Reader and
Friend. If I had only time and strength enough to
bear me through the full relation of the riches and
happiness you have conferred upon me! There are
letters in that desk over there between the windows
that have caused me to look down with a sense of compassionate
superiority upon Nathan Rothschild and the
Duke of Brunswick. I am too modest (or miserly) to
show them; but now and then, when threatened with a
fit of self-depreciation, I come in here, lock the door,
stop the keyhole, get them out and read them anew.
For three days thereafter I walk on air. For the refrain
of all is the same. “You have been a help to
me!” And only <span class="smcap">He</span> who knows the depths, sad and
silent, or rich and glad, of the human heart can
understand how much I wanted to help you. Verily, I
have in this matter had my reward. Again, I say, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
am grateful. Had I “helped” you a hundred times as
well as I have, I should still be your debtor.</p>

<p>May I read you somewhat copious extracts from a
letter I received, the other day, from a wide-awake
New England girl? Not only wide-awake, but refined,
original and sprightly; a girl whom though I
have never seen her face, I know to be a worker in
life as well as a thinker. She says some things much
better than I could have put them, and others as noteworthy,
which I wish to answer,—or, try to answer—since
I recognize in her a representative of a class, not
very large, perhaps, but certainly one of the most respectable
and honored of all those for whom I write
the “Common-Sense Series.” I should like to give
the letter in full, from the graphic touches with which
she sketches herself, “sitting upon the kitchen-table,
reading ‘Common Sense in the Household,’” one bright
morning, when herself and sisters had taken possession
of the kitchen to make preparation for “an old New
England tea-party,” at which their only assistant was
to be “a small maiden we keep to have the privilege
of waiting upon, and doing our own work into the
bargain; who, in waiting at table, was never known
to pass anything on the right side, and has an invincible
objection to learning how”—to the conclusion,
over against which she has, like the frank woman she
is, set her name and address in full.</p>

<p>But the modesty (or miserliness) aforesaid rises in
sudden arms to forbid the reproduction at my hand
of certain portions of the epistle, and it would be neither
kind nor honorable to set down in prospective
print her pictures of home life and <i>dramatis personæ</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Steering clear, when possible, of these visible rocks
and sunken reefs, I will indulge you and myself with
a part of that which has added sensibly to my treasures—not
debt—mind you! of gratitude.</p>

<p>“I want to tell you how much your compilation
does for those poor mortals whom it rescues from the
usual class of cook-books.”</p>

<p>A reef, you see, before we are out of harbor! We
will skip two pages to get at one of the well-said
things I spoke of just now.</p>

<p>“You speak of ‘company china’ and ‘company
manners.’ I detest company <i>anything!</i> This longing
for show and display is the curse and failing of
Americans. I abhor the phrase ‘Anything will do
for us.’ I do not believe that a person can be true
clear through and without affectations who can put on
her politeness with her company china any more than
a real lady can deliberately put on stockings with holes
in them. I seriously think that, so far from its being
self-sacrifice to put up with the meanest every day,
and hospitality to use the best for company, it is a positive
damage to one’s sense of moral fitness. I knew a
woman once who used to surprise me with the deceptions
in which she unconsciously and needlessly indulged.
This ceased to be a surprise when I saw her wear a
twenty-dollar hat and a pair of unmended hose, and not
seem to know that it was not quite the proper thing.”</p>

<p>Orthodox, you perceive, thus far, is our New England
correspondent. Honest and outspoken in her
hatred of shams and “dodges” of all kinds; quick to
see analogies and deduce conclusions. Now comes the
pith of the communication:—<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wish you could set me right on one point that often
perplexes me. <i>Is housekeeping worth while?</i> I do
not despise the necessary work. On the contrary, I
hold that anything well done is worth doing. But
with the materials this country affords, <i>can</i> housekeeping
be well done? Is it worth while for a woman
to neglect the talents she has, and can use to her own
and her friends’ advantage, in order to have a perfectly
appointed house? to wear herself out chasing around
after servants and children that things may be always
done well, and at the stated time? I have seen so
many women of brains wear out and die in harness,
trying to do their self-imposed duty; to see that the
large establishments their husbands’ wealth, position
and wishes place in their care shall be perfect in detail.
And these women could have been so happy and
enjoyed the life they threw away, if they had only
known how <i>not</i> to keep house. While, on the other
hand, with a small income and one servant the matter
is so much worse. I should not mind if one could ever
say ‘It is a well-finished thing!’ But you only
finish one thing to begin over again, and so on, until
you die and have nothing to show for your life’s work.
It looks hopeless to me, I confess. I wish you would
show me the wisdom—or the folly of it all.”</p>

<p>Now, I do not propose to show the folly of anything
such as a girl that writes. She is a sincere inquirer
after truth. When her letter came I tucked it under
my inkstand, and said, “There is a text ready-written,
and in clerkly hand, for my next ‘Familiar Talk!’”
She is altogether too sensible and has too true a
sense of humor to be offended when I tell her, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
shall, that her lament over unfinished work reminded
me comically of the story of the poor fellow who cut
his throat, because, as he stated in his letter of explanation
and farewell—“He was tired of buttoning and
unbuttoning!” There is a deal that is specious in the
threadbare adage set forth in dolesome rhyme:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Man’s work is from sun to sun,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But woman’s work is never done.”</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>Nothing in this world, or in all time, is finished. Or,
if finished, it is <i>not</i> well with it. We hear this truth
reiterated in every stroke of the artisan’s hammer, employed—from
the day he enters upon his apprenticeship
to that on which the withered hand can no longer,
by reason of age, lift the ponderous emblem of his
craft—in beating upon what looks to the observer of
to-day like that which engaged him yesterday; which
to the spectator of twenty to-morrows will seem the
same as that which calls out the full strength of the
brawny arm this hour. When he dies, who will care
to chronicle the circumstance that he made, in the
course of a long and busy life, forty thousand horseshoes,
or assisted in the manufacture of one thousand
engine-boilers? We learn the same lesson from the
patient eyes of the teacher while drilling one generation
after another in the details that are the tedious
forging of the wards of the key of knowledge;—the
rudiments of “the three R’s,” which, laugh or groan
as we may, must be committed to memories more or
less reluctant. They were never, I am sure, “learned
by heart.” It is well, so far as they are concerned,
that the old phrase has gone out of fashion. We read
the like tale of ever-renewed endeavor in the bent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
brows and whitening locks of brain-toilers, the world
over. Nature were a false teacher were this otherwise.
Birth, maturity, death; first, the blade then the ear,
and, after the full corn in the ear, ripening and destruction
for the good of man or beast, or decay in the
earth that resurrection may come to the buried seed.
Seed-time and harvest, summer and winter,—none
of these are “finished things.” <span class="smcap">God</span> hold our eyes
from seeing many things that are!</p>

<p>A life, the major part of which is spent in sweeping,
that the dust may re-settle; in washing, that clothes
may be again worn and soiled; in cooking, that the
food prepared may be consumed; in cleansing plates
and dishes, to put back upon the table that they may
return, in grease and stickiness, to the hardly-dried
pan and towel, does seem to the superficial spectator,
ignoble even for the wife of a struggling mechanic or
ill-paid clerk. But I insist that the fault is not that
Providence has made her a woman, but that Providence
has made and kept her poor. Her husband at
his bench, or, rounding his shoulders over his ledger,
has as valid cause of complaint of never done work. Is
there any reason why he should stand more patiently
in his lot, waiting to see what <span class="smcap">God</span> the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will do,
than she?</p>

<p>But—“Is it worth while for a woman to neglect the
talents she has, and can use to her own and her friends’
advantage, in order to have a perfectly-appointed
house, etc.?”</p>

<p>Certain visions that stir me to reverential admiration,
arise before me, at that query. I see Emily Bronté
reading German while she kneads the batch of home-made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
bread; Charlotte, laying down the pen upon an
unfinished page of Shirley, to steal into the kitchen
when poor blind Tabby’s back is turned, and bear off
the potatoes the superannuated servant insists upon
peeling every day, that the “dainty fingers” may extract
the black “eyes” the faithful old creature cannot
see. I see the Greek grammar fixed open in the rack
above Elihu Burritt’s forge; and Sherman, reciting
to himself by day over his lapstone and last, the lessons
he learned at night after work-hours were over. I recollect
that the biographer of the “marvellous boy”
has written of him—“Twelve hours he was chained to
the office; <i>i.e.</i>, from eight in the morning until eight
at night, the dinner-hour only excepted; and in the
house he was confined to the kitchen; slept with the
foot-boy, and was subjected to indignities of a like
nature. Yet here it was, during this life of base
humiliation, that Thomas Chatterton worked out the
splendid creations of his imagination. In less than
three years of the life of a poor attorney’s apprentice,
fed in the kitchen and lodged with the foot-boy, did
he here achieve an immortality such as the whole life
of not one in millions is sufficient to create.”</p>

<p>Note here, too, that Chatterton died of a broken
heart; was not driven to suicide by hard work.</p>

<p>Please be patient with me while I tell you of an incident
that seems to me pretty, and comes in patly
just at this point.</p>

<p>I have a friend—my heart bounds with prideful
pleasure while I call her such!—who is the most
scholarly woman, and also the best housekeeper I
know. She is, moreover, one of the sweetest of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
native poets—one to whose genius and true womanhood
even royalty has done grateful honor; a woman
who ‘has used her’ every ‘talent to her own and her
friends’ advantage’ in more ways than one. She had
a call one day from a neighbor, an eminent professor,
learned in dead and spoken tongues. In the passage
of the conversation from trifles to weightier matters,
it chanced that she differed in opinion from him upon
two points. He refused to believe that potatoes could
ever be made into a palatable sweet by any ingenuity
of the culinary art, and he took exception to her
rendering of a certain passage of Virgil. In the course
of the afternoon he received from his fair neighbor a
folded paper and a covered dish. Opening the former,
he read a metrical translation of the disputed passage,
so beautiful and striking he could no longer doubt that
she had discovered the poet’s meaning more truly than
had he. The dish contained a delicious potato custard.</p>

<p>A foolscap page of rhymed thanks went back with
the empty pudding-dish. It was mere doggerel, for
the pundit was no poet, and meant his note for nothing
more than jingle and fun, but his tribute of admiration
was sincere. I forget the form of its expression,
except that the concluding lines ran somewhat thus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“From Virgil and potatoes, too,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">You bring forth treasures rich and new.”</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>Am I harsh and unsympathetic when I say, that in
ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, if a woman has
genuine talent, she will find time to improve it even
amid the clatter of household machinery? I could
multiply instances by the thousand to prove this, did
time permit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>But what of the poor rich woman who throws away
her life in the vain endeavor to bring servants and
children “up to time?” Two things. First, she dies
of worry, not of work—a distinction with a difference.</p>

<p>Second, if she possess one-half enough strength of
mind and strength of purpose to have made herself
mistress of a single art or science, or sufficient tact to
sustain her as a successful leader in society, or the degree
of administrative ability requisite to enable her
to conduct rightly a public enterprise of any note, be
it benevolent, literary, or social, she ought to be competent
to the government of her household; to administer
domestic affairs with such wise energy as should
insure order and punctuality without self-immolation.</p>

<p>“If they have run with the footmen and they have
wearied them, how shall they contend with horses?”</p>

<p>Let us look at this matter fairly, and without prejudice
on either side. I should contradict other of my written
and spoken opinions; stultify myself beyond the recovery
of your respect or my own, were I to deny that
more and wider avenues of occupation should be opened
to woman than are now conceded as their right by the
popular verdict. But <i>not</i> because the duties of the
housewife are overburdensome or degrading. On the
contrary, I would have forty trained cooks where there
is now one; would make her who looketh diligently to
the ways of her household worthy, as in Solomon’s day,
of double honor. Of co-operative laundries I have
much hope. I would have washing-day become a tradition
of the past to be shuddered over by every
emancipated family in the land. In “co-operative
housekeeping,” in the sense in which it is generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
understood, I have scanty faith as a cure for the general
untowardness of what my sprightly correspondent
styles “the materials this country affords.” Somebody
must get the dinners and somebody superintend the
getting-up of these. I honestly believe that the best
method of reforming American domestic service and
American cookery is by making the mistress of every
home proficient in the art and a capable instructress
of others. I know—no one better—how women who
have never cared to beautify their own tables, or to
study elegant variety in their bills of fare, who have
railed at soups as “slops,” and <i>entrées</i> as “trash,”
talk, after the year’s travel in foreign lands their husband’s
earnings and their own pinching have gained
for them. How they groan over native cookery and
the bondage of native mistresses, and tell how cheaply
and luxuriously one can live in <i>dear</i> Paris.</p>

<p>“Will the time ever come,” they cry, “when we, too,
can sit at ease in our frescoed saloons surrounded by
no end of artificial flowers and mirrors, and order our
meals from a restaurant?”</p>

<p>To which I, from the depths of my home-loving
heart, reply, “Heaven forbid!”</p>

<p>Have you ever thought how large a share the kitchen
and dining-room have in forming the distinctive characteristics
of the home? It is no marvel that the man
who has had his dinners from an eating-house all his
life should lack a word to describe that which symbolizes
to the Anglo-Saxon all that is dearest and most
sacred on earth. I avow, without a tinge of shame,
that I soon tire, then sicken of restaurant and hotel
dainties. I like the genuine wholesomeness of home-fare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Madame,” said a Frenchman whom I once met at
an American watering-place, “one of my compatriots
could produce one grand repast—one that should not
want for the beautiful effects, with the contents of that
pail—tub—bucket—of what the peoples here call the
<i>svill</i>,” pointing to a mass of dinner <i>débris</i> set just without
a side door.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” I rejoined, with a grimace that matched
his, “<i>moi, je n’aime pas le svill!</i>”</p>

<p>He was right, without doubt, in the implication that
very much is thrown away as refuse which could be reproduced
upon the table to the satisfaction and advantage
of host and guest. Perhaps my imagination
was more to blame than he for my unlucky recollection
of his countrywoman’s recommendation of a mayonnaise
to a doubting guest:</p>

<p>“You need not fear to partake, madame. The fish
has been preserved from putrefaction by a process of
vinegar and charcoal!”</p>

<p>It is a substantial comfort to the Anglo-Saxon
stomach for its owner to know what he is eating. Call
it prejudice, if you like, but it may have something to
do with making one “true clear through,” as my
Yankee girl puts it.</p>

<p>“But such poetic repasts!” sighs my travelled acquaintance.
“Such heavenly garnishes, and flowers
everywhere, and the loveliest side-dishes, and everything
so exquisitely served! When I think of them, I abominate
our great, vulgar joints and stiff dinner-tables!”</p>

<p>Yet Mrs. Nouveau Riche dawdles all the forenoon
over a piece of tasteless embroidery, and gives the
afternoon to gossip; while Bridget or Dinah prepares<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
dinner, and serves it in accordance with her peculiar
ideas of right and fitness.</p>

<p>“Train American servants?” she says, in a transport
of contemptuous incredulity at my suggestion that here
is good missionary ground, “I have had enough of
that! Just as soon as I teach them the rudiments of
decent cookery they carry off their knowledge to somebody
else, trade for double wages from my neighbor
upon what they have gained from me!”</p>

<p>“But,” I remark, argumentatively, “do you not see,
my dear lady, that so surely as ‘ten times one is ten,’
if all your neighbors were, in like manner, to instruct
the servants who come to <i>them</i> and desert, so soon as
they are taught their trade, the great work of securing
wholesome and palatable cookery and tasteful serving
would soon be an accomplished fact in your community?
and, by the natural spread of the leaven, the
race of incompetent cooks and clumsy waiters would
before long become extinct? Would it not be worth
while for housekeepers to co-operate in the attempt to
secure excellence in these departments instead of
‘getting along somehow’ with ‘the materials’—<i>i. e.</i>,
servants—‘this country affords?’ Why not compel
the country—wrong-headed abstraction that it is!—to
afford us what we want? Would not the demand, thus
enforced and persisted in, create a supply?”</p>

<p>“Not in my day,” she retorts, illogically. “I don’t
care to wear myself out for the benefit of posterity.”</p>

<p>I do not gainsay the latter remark. If she had any
desire that the days to come should be better than these,
she would see to it that her daughters are rendered
comparatively independent of the ungrateful caprices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of the coming Celt or Teuton, or the ambitious vagaries
of “the Nation’s Ward,” by a practical knowledge of
housewifery. Perhaps she is deterred from undertaking
their instruction by the forecast shadow of their
desertion of the maternal abode for homes of their
own.</p>

<p>The prettiest thing that has ever been said of the
informal “talks” I had with you, my Reader, in former
days, was the too-flattering remark of a Syracuse
(N. Y.) editor, that they were “like a breath of fresh
air blowing across the ‘heated term’ of the cook.”</p>

<p>I quote it, partly that I may thank the author, principally
that I may borrow the illustration. The heavenly
airs that really temper the torrid heats of the
kitchen are loving thoughts of those for whom the
house-mother makes the home. There is a wealth of
meaning in the homely old saying about “putting one’s
name in the pot.” It is one thing, I submit to the advocates
of co-operative housekeeping, whether big John’s
and little John’s and Mamie’s and Susie’s and Tommy’s
meals are prepared according to the prescriptions of a
salaried <i>chef</i>, in the mammoth boilers, steamers and
bakers of an “establishment” along with the sustenance
of fifty other families, or whether the tender
mother, in her “order of the day,” remembers that
while Papa likes smart, tingling dashes of cayenne,
garlic, and curry, the baby-tongues of her brood would
cry out at the same; that Mamie has an aversion to a
dish much liked by her brothers and sisters; that Susie
is delicate, and cannot digest the strong meat that is
the gift of flesh and brains to the rest. So Papa gets
his spiced ragoût under a tiny cover—hot-and-hot—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the plainer “stew,” which was its base, nourishes the
bairns. Mamie is not forced to fast while the rest
feast, and by pale Susie’s plate is set the savory “surprise,”
which is the visible expression of loving kindness,
always wise and unforgetting.</p>

<p>You remember the legend that tells how Elizabeth
of Hungary, having been forbidden by her lord to
carry food to the poor, was met one day by him outside
the castle walls, as she was bearing a lapful of
meat and bread to her pensioners. Louis demanding
sternly what she carried in her robe, she was obliged
to show him the forbidden burden. “Whereupon,”
says the chronicler, “the food was miraculously
changed, for his eyes, to a lapful of roses, red-and-white,
and, his mind disabused of suspicion, he graciously
bade her pass on whithersoever she would.”</p>

<p>I have bethought me many times of the legend when
I have seen upon very modest tables such proofs of
thoughtful recollection of the peculiar tastes and needs of
the flock to which the home caterer ministered as made
my heart warm and eyes fill, and threw, to my imagination,
chaplets lovelier than Elizabeth’s roses around
the platter and bowl. This is the true poetry of serving,
and the loving appreciation of it is the reward,
rich and all-sufficient, of thought, care, and toil.</p>

<p>A few words more before we proceed, in due order, to
business. This volume is not an amendment to “General
Receipts, No. 1 of the Common-Sense Series.” Still
less is it intended as a substitute for it. I have carefully
avoided the repetition, in this volume, of a single
receipt which appeared in that. This is designed to be
the second story in the edifice of domestic economy, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
materials of which I have accumulated since the first
was completed. As money makes money, and a snow-ball
gathers snow, so receipts, new, valuable, and curious,
flowed in upon me after “No. 1” was given to the
world. Some of the earliest to reach me were so good
that I began a fresh compilation by the time that
book was fairly off the press.</p>

<p>Let me say here what you may find useful in your
own researches and collections. My best ally in the
classification and preservation of the materials for
this undertaking has been the “The Household Treasury,”
published by Claxton, Remsen &amp; Haffelfinger,
Philadelphia, and arranged by a lady of that city. It
is a pretty volume of blank pages, a certain number of
which are devoted to each department of cookery,
beginning with soups, and running through the various
kinds of sweets, pickles, etc. Each is introduced by a
handsome vignette and appropriate motto, with a title
at the top of every page. The paper is excellent and
distinctly ruled. I wish I could put a copy into the
hands of every housekeeper who believes in system
of details, and development of her individual capabilities.
It has so far simplified and lightened the task of
preparing “Breakfast, Luncheon and Tea” for my
public, that I cannot withhold this recommendation of
it to others.</p>

<p>Yet if “General Receipts” was written <i>con amore</i>,
its successor has been, in a still higher degree, a work of
love and delight. There were times during the preparation
of the trial volume when I could not feel quite
sure of my audience. There has not been a moment, since
I began that which I now offer for your acceptance, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
which I have not been conscious of your full sympathy;
have not tasted, in anticipation, your enjoyment of that
which I have taken such pleasure in making ready.</p>

<p>Do not think me sentimental when I ask that the
Maltese cross, marking, as in the former work, such
receipts as I have tested and proved for myself to be
reliable, may be to you, dear friend and sister, like the
footprint of a fellow-traveler along the humble but
honorable pathway of every-day and practical life,
bringing comfort and encouragement, even in the
“heated term.”</p>

<h2>EGGS.<br />
————————</h2>



<p>“Give me half-a-dozen eggs, a few spoonfuls of
gravy and as much cream, with a spoonful of butter
and a handful of bread crumbs, and I can get up a
good breakfast or luncheon,” said a housekeeper to me
once, in a modest boastfulness that became her well,
in my eyes.</p>

<p>For I had sat often at her elegant, but frugal board,
and I knew she spoke the truth.</p>

<p>“Elegant and frugal!” I shall have more hope of
American housewives when they learn to have faith in
this combination of adjectives. Nothing has moved me
more strongly to the preparation of this work than the
desire to convert them to the belief that the two are
not incompatible or inharmonious. Under no head can
practice in the endeavor to conform these, the one to
the other, be more easily and successfully pursued
than under that which begins this section.</p>

<p>Eggs at sixty cents per dozen (and they are seldom
higher than this price) are the cheapest food for the
breakfast or lunch-table of a private family. They are
nutritious, popular, and never (if we except the cases
of omelettes, thickened with uncooked flour, and fried
eggs, drenched with fat) an unelegant or homely dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Eggs Sur le Plat.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>6 eggs.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of butter or nice dripping.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt to taste.</p>

<p>Melt the butter on a stone-china, or tin plate, or
shallow baking-dish. Break the eggs carefully into
this; dust lightly with pepper and salt, and put in a
moderate oven until the whites are well “set.”</p>

<p>Serve in the dish in which they were baked.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Toasted Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Cover the bottom of an earthenware or stone-china
dish with rounds of delicately toasted bread. Or, what
is even better, with rounds of stale bread dipped in
beaten egg and fried quickly in butter or nice dripping,
to a golden-brown. Break an egg carefully
upon each, and set the dish immediately in front of,
and on a level with a glowing fire. Toast over this
as many slices of <i>fat</i> corned pork or ham as there are
eggs in the dish, holding the meat so that it will fry
very quickly, and all the dripping fall upon the eggs.
When these are well “set,” and a crust begins to form
upon the top of each, they are done. Turn the dish
several times while toasting the meat, that the eggs
may be equally cooked.</p>

<p>Do not send the fried pork to table, but pepper the
eggs lightly and remove with the toast, to the dish in
which they are to go to the table, with a cake-turner
or flat ladle, taking care not to break them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Eggs.</span> (No. 1.) <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>6 eggs.</p>

<p>4 tablespoonfuls good gravy—veal, beef or poultry. The latter is particularly nice.</p>

<p>1 handful bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>6 rounds buttered toast or fried bread.</p>

<p>Put the gravy into a shallow baking-dish. Break
the eggs into this, pepper and salt them, and strew the
bread-crumbs over them. Bake for five minutes in a
quick oven. Take up the eggs carefully, one by one,
and lay upon the toast which must be arranged on a
hot, flat dish. Add a little cream, and, if you like,
some very finely-chopped parsley and onion, to the
gravy left in the baking-dish, and turn it into a saucepan.
Boil up once quickly, and pour over the eggs.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Eggs.</span> (No. 2.) <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>6 eggs.</p>

<p>1 cup of chicken, game, or veal gravy.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful mixed parsley and onion, chopped fine.</p>

<p>1 handful very fine bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt to taste.</p>

<p>Pour enough gravy into a neat baking-dish to cover
the bottom well, and mix with the rest the parsley and
onion. Set the dish in the oven until the gravy begins
to hiss and bubble, when break the eggs into it, so that
they do not crowd one another. Strew bread-crumbs
thickly over them, pepper and salt, and return to the
oven for three minutes longer. Then pour the rest of
the gravy, which should be hot, over the whole. More<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
bread-crumbs, as fine as dust, and bake until the eggs
are “set.”</p>

<p>Send to table in the baking-dish.</p>

<p>This dish will be found very savory.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricasseed Eggs.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>6 hard-boiled eggs. When cold, slice with a sharp knife, taking care not to break the yolk.</p>

<p>1 cup good broth, well seasoned with pepper, salt, parsley and a suspicion of onion.</p>

<p>Some rounds stale bread, fried to a light-brown in butter or nice dripping.</p>

<p>Put the broth on the fire in a saucepan with the seasoning
and let it come to a boil. Rub the slices of egg
with melted butter, then roll them in flour. Lay them
gently in the gravy and let this become smoking hot
upon the side of the range, but do not let it actually
boil, lest the eggs should break. They should lie thus
in the gravy for at least five minutes. Have ready,
upon a platter, the fried bread. Lay the sliced egg
evenly upon this, pour the gravy over all, and serve
hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Egg Cutlets.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>6 hard-boiled eggs.</p>

<p>1 raw egg well-beaten.</p>

<p>1 handful very fine, dry bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt, and a little parsley minced fine.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls butter or dripping.</p>

<p>1 cup broth, or drawn butter, in which a raw egg has been beaten.</p>

<p>Cut the boiled eggs when perfectly cold, into rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
thick slices with a sharp, thin knife; dip each slice
into the beaten egg; roll in the bread-crumbs which
should be seasoned with pepper, salt and minced parsley.
Fry them to a light-brown in the butter or dripping,
turning each piece as it is done on the under
side. Do not let them lie in the frying-pan an instant
after they are cooked. Drain free from fat before laying
them on a hot dish. Pour the gravy, boiling hot,
over the eggs, and send to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stirred Eggs.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>6 eggs.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls of gravy—that made from poultry is best.</p>

<p>Enough fried toast, from which the crust has been pared, to cover the bottom of a flat dish.</p>

<p>A very little anchovy paste.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of butter.</p>

<p>Melt the butter in a frying-pan, and when hot, break
into this the eggs. Stir in the gravy, pepper and salt
to taste, and continue to stir very quickly, and well up
from the bottom, for about two minutes, or until the
whole is a soft, yellow mass. Have ready in a flat dish
the fried toast, spread thinly with anchovy paste.</p>

<p>Heap the stirred egg upon this, and serve before it
has time to harden.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Eggs</span> (<i>Raw</i>). <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>6 eggs.</p>

<p>4 or 5 table-spoonfuls of ground or minced ham.</p>

<p>A little chopped parsley.</p>

<p>A very little minced onion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>2 great spoonfuls of cream, and 1 of melted butter.</p>

<p>Salt and pepper to taste.</p>

<p>½ cup of bread crumbs moistened with milk and a spoonful of melted butter.</p>

<p>Line the bottom of a small deep dish, well-buttered,
with the soaked bread-crumbs; put upon these a layer
of chopped ham, seasoned with the onion and parsley.
Set these in the oven, closely covered, until they are
smoking hot. Meanwhile, beat up the eggs to a stiff
froth, season with pepper and salt, stir in the cream
and a spoonful of melted butter, and pour evenly upon
the layer of ham. Put the dish, uncovered, back into the
oven, and bake five minutes, or until the eggs are
“set.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Eggs</span> (<i>Hard-boiled</i>). <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>6 eggs boiled, and when cold, cut into thin slices.</p>

<p>1 cupful fine bread-crumbs, well moistened with a little good gravy and a little milk or cream.</p>

<p>½ cup thick drawn butter, into which has been beaten the yolk of an egg.</p>

<p>1 small cupful minced ham, tongue, poultry, or cold halibut, salmon, or cod.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt to taste.</p>

<p>Put a layer of moistened crumbs in the bottom of a
buttered baking-dish. On this lay the sliced eggs,
each piece of which must have been dipped in the
thick drawn butter. Sprinkle the ground meat over
these, cover with another layer of bread-crumbs, and
proceed in like manner, until the egg is all used up.
Sift on the top a good layer of dry bread-crumbs.
Cover the dish with an inverted plate, until the contents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
are heated through, then remove the plate, and
brown the top upon the upper grating of the oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Whirled Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>6 eggs.</p>

<p>1 quart of boiling water.</p>

<p>Some thin slices of buttered toast.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt to taste.</p>

<p>A table-spoonful of butter.</p>

<p>Put the water, slightly salted, in a saucepan over
the fire, and keep it at a fast boil. Stir with a wooden
spoon or ladle in one direction until it whirls rapidly.
Break the eggs, one at a time, into a cup, and drop
each carefully into the centre, or vortex of the boiling
whirlpool, which must be kept in rapid motion until
the egg is a soft, round ball. Take it out carefully
with a perforated spoon, and put it on a slice of buttered
toast laid upon a hot dish. Put a bit of butter
on the top. Set the dish in the oven to keep it warm,
and proceed in the same way with each egg, having
but one at a time in the saucepan. When all are done,
dust lightly with salt and pepper, and send up <i>hot</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Poached Eggs</span> <i>à la Bonne Femme</i>. <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>6 eggs.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful of vinegar.</p>

<p>½ cup nice veal or chicken broth.</p>

<p>Salt and pepper to taste.</p>

<p>½ cup butter or dripping.</p>

<p>Rounds of stale bread, and the beaten yolks of two raw eggs.</p>

<p>Prepare the bread first by cutting it into rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
large rounds, and, with a smaller cutter, marking an
inner round on each, leaving a narrow rim or wall
on the outside. Excavate this cautiously, not to break
the bottom of the cup thus indicated, which should
be three-quarters of an inch deep. Dip each round
thus prepared in the beaten egg, and fry quickly
to a yellow-brown in hot butter or dripping. Put in
order upon a flat dish, and set in the open oven while
you poach the eggs.</p>

<p>Pour about a quart of boiling water into a deep
saucepan. Salt slightly, and add the vinegar. Break
the eggs into a saucer, one at a time, and, when the
water is at a hard boil, slide them singly into the
saucepan. If the yolk be broken in putting it in, the
effect of the dish is spoiled. When the whites begin
to curdle around the edges, lessen the heat, and cook
slowly until they are firm enough to bear removal.
Take them out with a perforated skimmer, trim each
dexterously into a neat round, and lay within the
bread-cup described above. When all are in their
places, pour over them the gravy, which should be well
seasoned and boiling hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Eggs Poached with Mushrooms.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>6 eggs.</p>

<p>1 tea-cupful of cold chicken or other fowl, minced fine.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls of butter.</p>

<p>About a cupful of good gravy,—veal or poultry.</p>

<p>2 dozen mushrooms of fair size, sliced.</p>

<p>Some rounds of fried bread.</p>

<p>1 raw egg beaten light.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Mince the cold meat very fine and work into it the
butter, with the beaten egg. Season with pepper and
salt, and stir it over the fire in a saucepan until it is
smoking-hot. Poach the eggs as in preceding receipt,
and trim off the ragged edges. The fried bread must
be arranged upon a hot, flat dish, the mince of chicken
on this, and the eggs upon the chicken. Have ready
in another saucepan the sliced mushrooms and gravy.
If you use the French <i>champignons</i>—canned—they
should have simmered in the gravy fifteen minutes. If
fresh ones, you should have parboiled them in clean
water as long, before they are sliced into the gravy,
and stewed ten minutes in it. The gravy must be
savory, rich and rather highly seasoned. Pour it very
hot upon the eggs.</p>

<p>If you will try this receipt, and that for “Eggs <i>à la
bonne femme</i>” for yourself, your family and your guests
will be grateful to you, and you to the writer.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Anchovy Toast with Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>6 eggs.</p>

<p>1 cupful drawn butter—drawn in milk.</p>

<p>Some rounds of stale bread, toasted and buttered.</p>

<p>A little anchovy paste.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt to taste.</p>

<p>Spread the buttered toast thinly with anchovy paste,
and with this cover the bottom of a flat dish. Heat
the drawn butter to boiling in a tin vessel set in
another of hot water, and stir into this the eggs beaten
very light. Season to taste, and heat—stirring all the
time—until they form a thick sauce, but do not let them
boil. Pour over the toast, and send to table very hot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Forcemeat Eggs.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>6 eggs boiled hard.</p>

<p>1 cupful minced chicken, veal, ham or tongue.</p>

<p>1 cupful of rich gravy.</p>

<p>½ cupful bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>2 tea-spoonfuls mixed parsley, onion, summer savory or sweet marjoram, chopped fine.</p>

<p>Juice of half a lemon.</p>

<p>1 raw egg beaten light.</p>

<p>While the eggs are boiling, make the forcemeat by
mixing the minced meat, bread-crumbs, herbs, pepper
and salt together, and working well into this the beaten
raw egg. When the eggs are boiled hard, drop for a
minute into cold water to loosen the shells. Break
these away carefully. With a sharp knife divide each
egg into halves; cut a piece of the white off at each
end (that they may stand firmly when dished), and coat
them thickly with the forcemeat. Brown them by setting
them in a tin plate on the upper grating of a very
hot oven, and heap neatly upon a hot dish. Pour the
boiling gravy, in which a little lemon-juice has been
squeezed at the last, over them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Hen’s Nest.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>6 or 8 eggs boiled hard.</p>

<p>1 cup minced chicken, or other fowl, ham, tongue, or, if more convenient, any cold firm fish.</p>

<p>1 cup of drawn butter into which have been stirred two or three table-spoonfuls of good gravy and a tea-spoonful of chopped parsley.</p>

<p>When the eggs are quite cold and firm, cut the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
whites from the yolks in long thin strips, or shavings,
and set them aside to warm in a very gentle oven,
buttering them, now and then, while you prepare the
rest.</p>

<p>Pound the minced meat or fish very fine in a Wedgewood
mortar, mixing in, as you go on, the yolks of the
eggs, the parsley, and pepper and salt to taste. When
all are reduced to a smooth paste, mould with your
hands into small, egg-shaped balls. Heap in the centre
of a dish, arrange the shred eggs around them, in
imitation of a nest, and pour over all the hot sauce.</p>

<p>A simple and delightful relish.</p>

<h2>FISH.<br />

<small>ENTRÉES AND RELISHES OF FISH.</small></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">What to do with Cold Fish.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 cup drawn butter with an egg beaten in.</p>

<p>2 hard-boiled eggs.</p>

<p>Mashed potato—(a cupful will do.)</p>

<p>1 cupful cold fish—cod, halibut or shad.</p>

<p>Roe of cod or shad, and 1 table-spoonful of butter.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful minced parsley.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt to taste.</p>

<p>Dry the roe, previously well boiled. Mince the fish
fine, and season. Work up the roe with butter and the
yolks of the boiled eggs. Cut the white into thin
rings. Put a layer of mashed potato at the bottom of
a buttered deep dish—then, alternate layers of fish,
drawn butter (with the rings of white embedded in
this), roe,—more potato at top. Cover the dish and set
in a moderate oven until it smokes and bubbles.
Brown by removing the cover for a few minutes.
Send to table in the baking-dish, and pass pickles
with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Roes of Cod or Shad.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 or three roes. If large, cut them in two.</p>

<p>1 pint of boiling water.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of vinegar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Salt and pepper.</p>

<p>1 raw egg, well beaten.</p>

<p>½ cup fine bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls sweet lard, or dripping.</p>

<p>Wash the roes and dry with a soft, clean cloth.
Have ready the boiling water in which should be put
the vinegar, salt, and pepper. Boil the roes in this
for ten minutes, then plunge at once into very cold
water, slightly salted. Wipe dry again; when they
have lain about two minutes in this, roll in the beaten
egg, then the bread-crumbs, and fry to a fine brown in
the fat.</p>

<h4><i>Sauce for the above.</i></h4>

<p>1 cup drawn butter, into which beat a teaspoonful
of anchovy sauce, juice of half a lemon, and a pinch
of cayenne pepper, with a little minced parsley. Boil
up once, and send around in a gravy-boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roes of Cod or Shad Stewed.</span></h3>

<p>Wash the roes, and parboil in water with a little
vinegar, pepper, and salt added. It should be at a
hard boil when the roes go in. Boil five minutes, lay
in very cold water for two, wipe, and transfer to a
clean saucepan, with enough melted butter to half
cover them. Set it in a vessel of boiling water, cover
closely, and let it stew gently ten minutes. Should it
boil too fast the roes will shrink and toughen. While
they are stewing prepare the—</p>

<h4><i>Sauce.</i></h4>

<p>1 cup of boiling water.</p>

<p>2 teaspoonfuls corn-starch, or rice flour, mixed in cold water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of butter.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful chopped parsley.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful anchovy sauce, or good catsup.</p>

<p>Juice of half a lemon.</p>

<p>Beaten yolks of two eggs.</p>

<p>Salt and cayenne pepper.</p>

<p>Stir the corn-starch smoothly into the boiling water,
and set it over the fire, stirring constantly until it thickens
up well. Add pepper, salt, butter, and parsley;
mix well together, put in the lemon-juice and catsup,
lastly the roes, which should have been frequently
turned in the melted butter. Set within a vessel of
boiling water for about eight minutes, but do not let
the roes and sauce boil fast. Take them up, lay on a
flat, hot dish; add to the sauce the beaten yolks, stir
fast and well over the fire for two minutes, pour over
the roes, and serve.</p>

<p>Should the receipt for so simple a dish seem needlessly
prolix, I beg the reader to remember that I have
made it minute to save her time and trouble.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Roes.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>3 large roes.</p>

<p>1 cup of drawn butter and yolks of 3 hard-boiled eggs.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful anchovy paste or essence.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful of parsley.</p>

<p>Juice of half a lemon.</p>

<p>1 cup of bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>Salt and cayenne pepper to taste.</p>

<p>Boil the roes in water and vinegar, as directed in
former receipts; lay in cold water five minutes, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
wipe perfectly dry. Break them up with the back of
a silver spoon, or in a Wedgewood mortar, but not so
fine as to crush the eggs. When ready, they should be
a granulated heap. Set aside while you pound the
hard-boiled eggs to a powder. Beat this into the
drawn butter, then the parsley and other seasoning;
lastly, mix in, more lightly, the roes. Strew the bottom
of a buttered dish with bread-crumbs, put in the mixture,
spread evenly, and cover with very fine crumbs.
Stick bits of butter thickly over the top, cover and
bake in a quick oven, until bubbling hot. Brown, uncovered,
on the upper grating of the oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fish-Balls.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 cupfuls cold boiled cod—fresh or salted.</p>

<p>1 cupful mashed potato.</p>

<p>½ cup drawn butter, with an egg beaten in.</p>

<p>Season to taste.</p>

<p>Chop the fish when you have freed it of bones and
skin. Work in the potato, and moisten with the drawn
butter until it is soft enough to mould, and will yet
keep in shape. Roll the balls in flour, and fry
quickly to a golden-brown in lard, or clean dripping.
Take from the fat so soon as they are done; lay in a
cullender or sieve and shake gently, to free them from
every drop of grease. Turn out for a moment on
white paper to absorb any lingering drops, and send
up on a hot dish.</p>

<p>A pretty way of serving them is to line the dish
with clean, white paper, and edge this with a frill of
colored tissue paper—green or pink. This makes ornamental
that which is usually considered a homely dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Eels</span> <i>à l’Allemande</i>.</h3>

<p>1 cup of boiling water.</p>

<p>1 cup rather weak vinegar.</p>

<p>1 small onion, chopped fine.</p>

<p>A pinch of cayenne pepper.</p>

<p>½ saltspoonful mace.</p>

<p>1 saltspoonful salt.</p>

<p>About 2 pounds of eels.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls melted butter.</p>

<p>Chopped parsley to taste.</p>

<p>Make a liquor in which to boil the eels, of the
vinegar, water, onion, pepper, salt and mace. Boil—closely
covered—fifteen minutes, when strain and put
in the eels, which should be cleaned carefully and cut
into pieces less than a finger long. Boil <i>gently</i> nearly
an hour. Take them up, drain dry, and put into a
sauce made of melted butter and chopped parsley.
Set the vessel containing them in another of hot water,
and bring eels and sauce to the boiling point, then
serve in a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Eels Stewed</span> <i>à l’Americain</i>. <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>3 pounds eels, skinned and cleaned, and all the fat removed from the inside.</p>

<p>1 young onion, chopped fine.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls of butter.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt to taste, with chopped parsley.</p>

<p>Cut the eels in pieces about two inches in length;
season, and lay in a saucepan containing the melted
butter. Strew the onion and parsley over all, cover
the saucepan (or tin pail, if more convenient) closely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and set in a pot of cold water. Bring this gradually to
a boil, then cook very gently for an hour and a half,
or until the eels are tender. Turn out into a deep dish.</p>

<p>There is no more palatable preparation of eels than
this, in the opinion of most of those who have eaten it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricasseed Eels.</span></h3>

<p>3 pounds fresh eels, skinned, cleaned, and cut into pieces about two inches long.</p>

<p>1 small onion, sliced.</p>

<p>Enough butter, or good dripping, to fry the eels.</p>

<p>1 cup good beef or veal gravy, from which the fat has been skimmed. Season with wine, catsup and lemon-juice.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt with minced parsley for seasoning.</p>

<p>A little flour.</p>

<p>Flour the eels and fry in the dripping, or butter, until
brown. Take them out and set aside to cool while
you fry the sliced onion in the same fat. Drain this,
also the eels, from every drop of grease. When the
eels are almost cold, lay them in the bottom of a tin
pail or farina-kettle, sprinkle the onion, parsley and
other seasoning over them. Add to your gravy a little
anchovy sauce, or flavorous catsup; the juice of half a
lemon, and a glass of brown sherry. Pour over the
eels, cover closely, and set in a pot of <i>warm</i> water.
Bring to a gentle boil and simmer, after the contents
of the inner vessel are heated through, about twenty
minutes. Too much, or hard cooking, will spoil
them.</p>

<p>Serve upon a chafing-dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cutlets of Halibut, Cod or Salmon.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>3 pounds fish, cut in slices three-quarters of an inch thick, from the body of the fish.</p>

<p>A handful of fine bread-crumbs, with which should be mixed pepper and salt with a little minced parsley.</p>

<p>1 egg beaten light.</p>

<p>Enough butter, lard or dripping to fry the cutlets.</p>

<p>Cut each slice of fish into strips as wide as your two
fingers. Dry them with a clean cloth; rub lightly
with salt and pepper; dip in the egg, then the bread-crumbs,
and fry in enough fat to cover them well.
Drain away every drop of fat, and lay upon hot white
paper, lining a heated dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cutlets of Cod, Halibut or Salmon</span> <i>à la reine</i>.</h3>

<p>Prepare the fish as in the last receipt until after frying
it, when have ready the following sauce:</p>

<p>1 cup strong brown gravy—beef or veal.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful anchovy sauce or mushroom catsup.</p>

<p>Pepper, salt, a pinch of parsley and a <i>very</i> little minced onion.</p>

<p>1 glass brown sherry and juice of half a lemon.</p>

<p>Thicken with browned flour.</p>

<p>Lay the fried cutlets evenly in a broad saucepan
with a top, cover with the gravy and heat slowly all
through, <i>but do not let them boil</i>. Take up the cutlets
with care, and arrange upon a chafing-dish. Pour the
gravy over them.</p>

<p>These are very nice, and well worth the additional
trouble it may cost to prepare the sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Cod or Halibut.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>A piece of fish from the middle of the back, weighing four, five or six pounds.</p>

<p>A cupful of bread-crumbs, peppered and salted.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls <i>boiled</i> salt pork, finely chopped.</p>

<p>A table-spoonful chopped parsley, sweet marjoram and thyme, with a mere suspicion of minced onion.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful anchovy sauce, or Harvey’s, if you prefer it.</p>

<p>½ cupful drawn butter.</p>

<p>Juice of half a lemon.</p>

<p>1 beaten egg.</p>

<p>Lay the fish in very cold salt-and-water for two hours;
wipe dry; make deep gashes in both sides at right
angles with the back-bone and rub into these, as well as
coat it all over with a force-meat made of the crumbs,
pork, herbs, onion and seasoning, bound with raw egg.
Lay in the baking-pan and pour over it the drawn butter
(which should be quite thin), seasoned with the anchovy
sauce, lemon-juice, pepper and a pinch of parsley.
Bake in a moderate oven nearly an hour,—quite as
long if the piece be large, basting frequently lest it
should brown too fast. Add a little butter-and-water
when the sauce thickens too much. When the fish is
done, remove to a hot dish, and strain the gravy over it.</p>

<p>A few capers or chopped green pickles are a pleasant
addition to the gravy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Salmon with Cream Sauce.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>A middle cut of salmon.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls of butter melted in hot water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Butter a sheet of foolscap paper on both sides, and
wrap the fish up in it, pinning the ends securely together.
Lay in the baking-pan, and pour six or seven
spoonfuls of butter-and-water over it. Turn another
pan over all, and steam in a moderate oven from three-quarters
of an hour to an hour, lifting the cover, from
time to time, to baste and assure yourself that the paper
is not burning. Meanwhile, have ready in a saucepan
a cup of cream, in which you would do well to dissolve
a bit of soda a little larger than a pea. This is a wise
precaution whenever cream is to be boiled. Heat this
in a vessel placed within another of hot water; thicken
with a heaping teaspoonful of corn starch, add a tablespoonful
of butter, pepper and salt to taste, a liberal
pinch of minced parsley, and when the fish is unwrapped
and dished, pour half slowly over it, sending the
rest to table in a boat. If you have no cream, use
milk, and add a beaten egg to the thickening.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salmon Steaks or Cutlets (fried).</span></h3>

<p>Cut slices from the middle of the fish, an inch thick.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful butter to each slice, for frying.</p>

<p>Beaten egg and fine <i>cracker</i> crumbs, powdered to dust, and peppered with cayenne.</p>

<p>Wipe the fish dry, and salt slightly. Dip in egg,
then in cracker crumbs, fry very quickly in hot butter.
Drain off every drop of grease, and serve upon a dish
lined with hot, clean paper, fringed at the ends.</p>

<p>Sprinkle green parsley in bunches over it.</p>

<p>The French use the best salad-oil in this receipt, instead
of butter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salmon Steaks or Cutlets (broiled).</span></h3>

<p>Three or four slices of salmon.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful melted butter.</p>

<p>½ cup drawn butter, thickened with browned flour, and seasoned with tomato catsup.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt to taste.</p>

<p>Rub the steaks with the butter, pepper and salt
slightly. Broil upon a gridiron over a very clear fire,
turning often, and rubbing each side with butter as it
comes uppermost. When nicely browned, lay on a
hot dish, and pour the sauce over them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salmon Cutlets en Papillote.</span></h3>

<p>Dry and lay in melted butter ten minutes. Dust
lightly with cayenne pepper, and wrap securely in well
buttered or oiled white paper, stitching down the ends
of each cover. Fry in nice dripping or sweet lard.
They will be done in ten minutes, unless very thick.
Have ready clean, <i>hot</i> papers, fringed at both ends.
Clip the threads of the soiled ones when you have
drained them free from fat, slip dexterously and quickly,
lest they cool in the process, into the fresh covers,
give the fringed ends a twist, and send up on a
heated dish.</p>

<p>Salmon <i>en papillote</i> is also broiled by experts. If
you attempt this, be careful that the paper is so well
greased and the cutlets turned so often that it does not
scorch. The least taste of burnt paper ruins the flavor
of the fish, which it is the object of the cover to preserve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salmon in a Mould.</span> (<i>Very good.</i>) <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 can preserved salmon or an equal amount of cold, left from a company dish of roast or boiled.</p>

<p>4 eggs beaten light.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls butter—melted, but not hot.</p>

<p>½ cup fine bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>Season with pepper, salt and minced parsley.</p>

<p>Chop the fish fine, then rub it in a Wedgewood mortar,
or in a bowl with the back of a silver spoon,
adding the butter until it is a smooth paste. Beat the
bread-crumbs into the eggs and season before working
all together. Put into a buttered pudding-mould, and
boil or steam for an hour.</p>

<h4><i>Sauce for the Above.</i></h4>

<p>1 cupful milk heated to a boil, and thickened with a table-spoonful corn-starch.</p>

<p>The liquor from the canned salmon, or if you have none, double the quantity of butter.</p>

<p>1 great spoonful of butter.</p>

<p>1 raw egg.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful anchovy, or mushroom, or tomato catsup.</p>

<p>1 pinch of mace and one of cayenne.</p>

<p>Put the egg in last and very carefully, boil one
minute to cook it, and when the pudding is turned from
the mould, pour over it. Cut in slices at table.</p>

<p>A nice supper-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Salmon.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 can preserved fresh salmon, or remains of roast or boiled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>1 cup drawn butter.</p>

<p>2 eggs well beaten.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful anchovy or Harvey’s sauce.</p>

<p>Cayenne and salt to taste.</p>

<p>2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped fine.</p>

<p>Some capers or minced green pickles.</p>

<p>Stew the salmon in the can liquor, or a very little
water, slightly salted, ten minutes. Have ready, in a
larger saucepan, the drawn butter thickened with rice-flour
or corn-starch. Season and stir in cautiously the
beaten raw eggs, then the salmon. Let it come to a
gentle boil, add the chopped eggs and pickles and turn
into a covered deep dish.</p>

<h4><i>Or—</i></h4>

<p>Add the hard-boiled eggs and capers to the salmon,
with a table-spoonful of butter, toss up lightly with a
fork, pepper slightly, and heap in the centre of a hot
flat dish, then pour the boiling sauce over all.</p>

<p>It is very appetizing served in either way.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mayonnaise of Salmon.</span></h3>

<p>If you use canned salmon, drain it very dry and pick
into coarse flakes with a silver fork. If the remnants
of roast or boiled fish, remove all bits of bone, skin
and fat, and pick to pieces in the same way.</p>

<p>1 bunch of celery, or 2 heads of lettuce.</p>

<h4><i>For Dressing.</i></h4>

<p>1 cup boiling water.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful corn-starch.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls best salad-oil.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful made mustard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>½ cup vinegar.</p>

<p>1 small teaspoonful black pepper, or half as much cayenne.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful salt.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful melted butter.</p>

<p>2 raw eggs—yolks only,—beaten light.</p>

<p>2 hard-boiled eggs, yolks only.</p>

<p>2 teaspoonfuls powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Wet the corn-starch with cold water and stir into the
boiling water until it thickens well; add half of pepper,
salt, sugar, and all the butter. Remove from the
fire, and beat in the raw yolks while still scalding hot.
Set aside to cool, while you cut the celery or lettuce into
small pieces, tearing and bruising as little as may be.
Mix this lightly with the fish in a deep bowl. Rub
the boiled yolks to a powder, add the salt, sugar and
pepper, then the oil, little by little, beating it in with a
silver spoon; next, the mustard. When the thick egg
sauce is quite cold, whip the other into it with an
egg-beater, and when thoroughly incorporated, put in
the vinegar. Mix half the dressing through the fish
and celery, turn this into a salad-dish, mounding it
in the centre, and pour the rest of the dressing over
it.</p>

<p>Garnish with rings of boiled white-of-egg or whipped
raw whites, heaped regularly on the surface, with
a caper on top of each.</p>

<p>Do not be discouraged at the length of this receipt.
It is easy and safe. Your taste may suggest some modification
of the ingredients, but you will like it, in
the main, well enough to try it more than once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Devilled Salmon.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>½ pound smoked salmon, cut into strips half an inch wide and an inch long.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls good beef gravy, seasoned with onion.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful tomato or walnut catsup.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful vinegar.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls melted butter or best salad-oil.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful made mustard.</p>

<p>Cayenne to taste.</p>

<p>Boil the salmon ten minutes in clear water. Have
ready in a saucepan the gravy and seasoning, hot and
closely covered, but do not let it boil. Lay the salmon
for ten minutes more in the melted butter, turning it
several times. Then put into the hot gravy, cover and
simmer five minutes. Pile the fish upon a hot platter;
pour the sauce over it, and serve with split Boston
crackers, toasted and buttered.</p>

<p>Juice of half a lemon.</p>

<p>Cayenne pepper.</p>

<p>Parboil the salmon ten minutes; lay in cold water

parsley; squeeze the lemon-juice over all and
serve.</p>

<p>Mashed potato is an improvement to this dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salt Cod with Egg Sauce.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 pound salt cod, previously soaked, then boiled and allowed to cool, picked or chopped fine.</p>

<p>1 small cup milk or cream.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful corn-starch or flour.</p>

<p>2 eggs beaten light.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls of butter.</p>

sauce, and so on, leaving out the bread-crumbs until
the dish is full, when put a thick layer, with bits of
butter set closely in it. Bake covered until hot through,
then brown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricasseed Lobster.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Meat of a good-sized lobster, boiled.</p>

<p>1 cup rich veal, or chicken broth—quite thick.</p>

<p>½ cup cream.</p>

<p>Juice of half a lemon.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of butter.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt to taste.</p>

<p>Cut the lobster-meat in pieces half an inch square;
put with the gravy, pepper and salt, into a saucepan.
Cover and stew gently for five minutes. Add the
cream, and just as it is on the point of boiling, stir
in the butter. When this is melted, take the saucepan
from the fire, and stir in, very quickly, the lemon-juice.</p>

<p>Serve in a covered dish.</p>

<p>Boston crackers, split, delicately toasted, and buttered
while hot, are a nice accompaniment to this
fricassee.</p>

<p>Canned lobster may be used if you cannot procure
fresh.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lobster Rissoles.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 large lobster—boiled.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls of butter.</p>

<p>Yolks of 3 eggs.</p>

<p>Handful of bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of anchovy sauce.</p>

<p>Cayenne, salt, and chopped parsley to liking.</p>

<p>Pick the meat from the boiled lobster, and pound it
in a Wedgewood mortar with half the coral, seasoning
with salt and cayenne pepper. When you have rubbed
it to a smooth paste with the butter, add a table-spoonful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of anchovy sauce and the yolk of an egg, well
beaten. Flour your hands well and make the mixture
into egg-shaped balls. Roll these in beaten egg, then
in bread-crumbs, and fry to a light brown in sweet
lard, dripping, or butter.</p>

<h4><i>For the Sauce.</i></h4>

<p>The coral of the lobster rubbed smooth.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful anchovy sauce.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls melted butter.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of cream.</p>

<p>Have ready in a saucepan 4 table-spoonfuls of
melted butter; the remainder of the coral of the lobster
pounded fine, and stirred in carefully, and a teaspoonful
of anchovy sauce. Let this heat almost to boiling;
add the cream, and pour hot over the rissoles when
you have arranged these upon a heated dish.</p>

<p>Garnish with parsley or cresses.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lobster Cutlets</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Are made precisely as is the paste for rissoles, except
that enough flour is added to it to enable you to roll it
out into a sheet about as thick as your finger. Cut
this into strips about three inches in length and one in
width. Fry these quickly and drain dry before arranging
them in the dish.</p>

<p>Pour the sauce over them. If properly made and
fried, they are light and palatable.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lobster Croquettes.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 fine lobster, well boiled, or a can of lobster.</p>

<p>2 eggs, well beaten.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls of butter, melted, but not hot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>½ cup bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>Season with salt and cayenne pepper.</p>

<p>Pound the lobster-meat, coral and all, in a Wedgewood
mortar. Mix with this the bread-crumbs, then
the seasoning and butter. Bind with the yolk of one
egg. Flour your hands and make into oblong croquettes.
Dip in beaten egg, then in bread-crumbs,
and fry quickly to a light-brown in sweet lard or butter.
Drain off fat, by laying upon a hot, clean paper,
before dishing them.</p>

<p>Make a border of parsley close about them when
you have piled them tastefully in the dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lobster Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 large lobster well boiled, or a can of preserved lobster.</p>

<p>½ cup fine bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>½ cup cream or rich milk.</p>

<p>Cayenne pepper and salt.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful of Worcestershire or Harvey’s sauce.</p>

<p>¼ pound fat, salt pork, or corned ham, cut into <i>very</i> thin slices.</p>

<p>3 eggs.</p>

<p>Pound the meat and coral to a paste. Mix into this
two eggs well beaten, the seasoning, the bread-crumbs,
and one table-spoonful of cream. Stir all together until
light. Line the pudding-mould with the sliced ham.
Pour the mixture into this and fit on the top. Set into a
pot or pan of boiling water, and boil steadily for one hour.</p>

<h4><i>Sauce for Pudding.</i></h4>

<p>½ cup drawn butter.</p>

<p>The remainder of the cream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>


<p>A little chopped parsley.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful anchovy sauce.</p>

<p>Heat almost to boiling; stir in a beaten egg, and so
soon as this begins to thicken, take from the fire.</p>

<p>Turn the pudding out carefully upon a hot dish,
and pour the sauce over it. Cut with a sharp thin
knife.</p>

<p>Send around lemon cut into eighths, to be squeezed
over each slice, should the guests wish to do so.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Curried Lobster.</span></h3>

<p>1 large lobster, boiled.</p>

<p>1 large cup of strong veal or chicken broth.</p>

<p>1 shallot.</p>

<p>1 great spoonful of butter.</p>

<p>1 great spoonful chopped thyme and parsley.</p>

<p>Juice of 1 lemon.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful corn-starch.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful anchovy sauce.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful curry-powder.</p>

<p>Pick the meat very fine and set aside in a cool place.
Mince the onion, and put it with the chopped herbs,
the butter and a table-spoonful of hot water, into a small
covered saucepan. Set this over the fire until it begins
to simmer, then add the broth. Boil all together for
five minutes, strain as for soup, stir in the curry powder
and corn-starch, and stew gently ten minutes longer,
stirring often. Season as directed, and add the picked
lobster. Let the saucepan stand in a pan of boiling
water ten minutes, but do not let the contents of the
inner vessel boil. Pour into a deep dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Send around wafery slices of toast buttered while hot,
and pieces of lemon to be added if necessary.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Devilled Lobster.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 lobster, well boiled.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls butter.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful made mustard.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful anchovy sauce.</p>

<p>1 wine glass of vinegar.</p>

<p>Cayenne pepper and salt.</p>

<p>2 hard-boiled eggs.</p>

<p>Pick the meat carefully from the shell, breaking it
as little as may be. Rub the coral to a smooth paste
with the back of a silver spoon. Chop the meat fine.
Stir into this the butter, melted, but not hot, the yolks
of the eggs, rubbed smooth with the coral, the pepper,
mustard and salt, and put all together in a saucepan
over the fire. Stir until it is smoking hot, then turn
into the shell, which should be washed and heated.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Lobster.</span></h3>

<p>1 large lobster, well boiled.</p>

<p>1 cup good gravy—veal is best.</p>

<p>1 blade of mace.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls of melted butter.</p>

<p>Juice of half a lemon.</p>

<p>Cayenne and salt to liking.</p>

<p>1 glass sherry.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful chopped parsley.</p>

<p>Cut the meat of the lobster into pieces an inch long
and half as wide, keeping the coral until the last. Put
the meat, with the broth and seasoning, into a saucepan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and heat gently, stirring frequently until it is near
boiling. Then add the coral and butter (which should
previously be well rubbed together) and the chopped
parsley. When the mixture again nears the boiling
point, add the wine and lemon-juice and turn into a
deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Lobster</span> (No. 1).</h3>

<p>1 boiled lobster.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls of cream.</p>

<p>2 eggs well beaten.</p>

<p>½ cup bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>2 tablespoonfuls butter.</p>

<p>1 tea-spoonful anchovy sauce.</p>

<p>Season to taste with cayenne, salt and nutmeg.</p>

<p>Juice of half a lemon.</p>

<p>Rub the meat of the lobster, including the coral, a
little at a time, in a Wedgewood mortar with the butter,
until it is a soft paste. Put this into a saucepan with
the seasoning, and heat to boiling, stirring constantly.
Remove from the fire, and add the cream and lemon-juice,
stirring in well. Fill the lobster shell with this
mixture. Strew bread-crumbs over the top, and set on
the upper grate of a quick oven until the crumbs begin
to brown.</p>

<p>Send to table in the shell, laid upon a hot dish.</p>

<p>You can scallop crab in the same manner.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Lobster</span> (No. 2).</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<p>1 lobster, well boiled.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls of butter.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful of anchovy sauce.</p>

<p>½ cup of bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>½ cup of cream.</p>

<p>2 eggs well beaten.</p>

<p>Season with cayenne pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Cut the lobster carefully into halves with a sharp
knife. Pick out the meat carefully, and set aside
while you prepare the sauce. This is done by rubbing
the coral and the soft green substance, known as the
“pith,” together in a mortar or bowl, adding, a little
at a time, a table-spoonful of butter. Put this on
the fire in a covered saucepan, and stir until it is
smoking hot. Then, beat in the anchovy sauce, pepper
and salt before adding the cream. Heat quickly to a
boil, lest the cream should curdle, put in the picked
meat, and again stir up well from the sides and bottom
until very hot. The eggs, whipped to a froth, should
now go in. Remove the saucepan from the fire so
soon as this is done.</p>

<p>Have the upper and lower halves of the shell ready
buttered, strew bread-crumbs thickly in the bottom of
each, moisten these with cream, and pour in the lobster
mixture while still very hot. Put another layer of
bread-crumbs, well moistened with the remainder of
the cream, on the top. Stick bits of butter all over it,
and brown on the upper grating of a hot oven.</p>

<p>In either of these preparations of scalloped lobster,
should the canned lobster be used, or should you chance
to break the shell in getting out the meat, you may
bake the mixture prepared, as directed, in a pudding-dish
or small <i>paté</i> pans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Crabs</span></h3>

<p>Are so near of kin to the lobster family that the same
receipts may easily be used for both. Only, bear in
mind that the lesser and tougher shell-fish needs more
boiling than does the aristocratic lobster. If underdone,
crabs are very unwholesome. Also, in consideration
of the crab’s deficiency in the matter of the
coral which lends lusciousness and color to lobster
salads and stews, use more butter and cream in “getting
him up” for the table.</p>

<p>Cayenne pepper is regarded by many as necessary in
dishes of lobster or crab, because of its supposed efficacy
in preventing the evil effects which might otherwise
follow indulgence in these delicacies.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Soft Crabs.</span></h3>

<p>For a receipt for preparing these, please see “Common
Sense in the Household, No. 1,” page 71.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Turtle Fricassee.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>3 pounds turtle steak.</p>

<p>1 large cup strong veal gravy.</p>

<p>4 hard-boiled eggs—the yolks only.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful anchovy sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>1 teaspoonful Harvey’s sauce.</p>

<p>Juice of half a lemon.</p>

<p>2 dozen mushrooms.</p>

<p>1 small onion, minced fine.</p>

<p>1 bunch sweet herbs, minced.</p>

<p>1 glass wine, and butter for frying.</p>

<p>Browned flour for thickening, with cayenne and salt.</p>

<p>Cut the steak in strips as wide and as long as
three of your fingers; fry brown (when you have floured
them) in butter. Take up; drain off the grease; put
with the gravy, which should be ready heated, into a
tin vessel with a close cover and set in a pot of hot
water. It must not boil until you have put in the rest
of the ingredients. Slice the onion and mushrooms,
and fry in the same butter; add with the herbs and
other seasoning to the meat in the pail, or inner saucepan.
Cover and set to stew gently. To the butter left
in the frying-pan, add three spoonfuls of browned
flour (large ones) and stir to a smooth unctuous paste,
without setting it on the range. Add the lemon-juice
to this, and set aside until the turtle has simmered
half an hour in the broth. Take up the meat, and arrange
upon a covered hot-water dish; transfer the
gravy to a saucepan, and boil hard five minutes uncovered.
Put in the brown flour paste; stir up until it
thickens well; add the wine and yolks of eggs, each
cut in three pieces, and pour over the turtle.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Panned Oysters.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 quart of oysters.</p>

<p>Rounds of thin toast, delicately browned.</p>

<p>Butter, salt and pepper.</p>

<p>Have ready several small pans of block tin, with
upright sides. The ordinary “patty-pan” will do,
if you can get nothing better, but it is well, if you are
fond of oysters cooked in this way, to have the neat
little tins made, at a moderate price, at a tinsmith’s.
Cut stale bread in thin slices, then round—removing all
the crust—of a size that will just fit in the bottoms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
your pans. Toast these quickly to a light-brown,
butter and lay within your tins. Wet with a great
spoonful of oyster liquid, then, with a silver fork,
arrange upon the toast as many oysters as the pans
will hold without heaping them up. Dust with pepper
and salt, put a bit of butter on top and set the pans,
when all are full, upon the floor of a quick oven.
Cover with an inverted baking-pan to keep in steam
and flavor, and cook until the oysters “ruffle.” Eight
minutes in a brisk oven, should be enough. Send
very hot to the table in the tins in which they were
roasted.</p>

<p>Next to roasting in the shell, this mode of cooking
oysters best preserves the native flavor of the bivalves.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricasseed Oysters.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 pint good broth—veal or chicken—well strained.</p>

<p>1 slice of ham—corned is better than smoked.</p>

<p>3 pints oysters.</p>

<p>1 small onion.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls of butter.</p>

<p>½ cup of milk.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of corn-starch.</p>

<p>1 egg beaten light.</p>

<p>A little chopped parsley and sweet marjoram.</p>

<p>Pepper to taste and juice of a lemon.</p>

<p>If the ham be raw, soak in boiling water for half
an hour before cutting it into very small slices, and putting
it into the saucepan with the broth, the oyster
liquor, the onion minced <i>very</i> fine, the herbs and pepper.
Let these simmer for fifteen minutes, and boil
fast for five, then skim and put in the oysters. Boil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
up once briskly, keeping the contents of the saucepan
well stirred. Have ready the corn-starch, rubbed
smoothly into the milk. Stir this in and heat carefully,
using the spoon constantly until it boils and begins
to thicken, when the butter should go in. So soon
as this is melted take out the oysters with a skimmer;
put into a hot covered dish, heat the broth again to a
boil, remove the saucepan from the fire, and stir in
cautiously the beaten egg. A better way is to cook
the latter gradually by beating in with it a few tablespoonfuls
of the scalding liquor, before putting the
egg into the saucepan.</p>

<p>Turn the gravy over the oysters, and serve at once.
Squeeze in the lemon-juice after the tureen is on the
table, as it is apt to curdle the mixture if left to
stand.</p>

<p>Send around cream crackers, and green pickles or
olives with this savory dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oysters Boiled in the Shell.</span></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Large shell-oysters, washed very clean and scraped, but not opened.</p>

<p>Pot of boiling water over a hot fire.</p>

<p>Sauce of melted butter with chopped or powdered parsley.</p>

<p>A lemon, cut in half.</p>

<p>Put the oysters, one by one, quickly and carefully
into the water, which must be kept at a hard boil all the
time. In five minutes, turn off every drop of the
water by inverting the pot over a cullender, dry the
shells rapidly with a soft cloth and send to table upon
a hot dish. Squeeze a few drops of lemon-juice upon
each oyster, and put a little hot melted butter with
pepper over it before eating it from the shell.</p>

<p>The epicurean oyster-lover may consider boiled oysters
insipid, but they are liked by many.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Oysters</span> (No. 1). <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Butter.</p>

<p>Fine bread-crumbs, or rolled cracker.</p>

<p>Minced parsley, pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Lemon-juice.</p>

<p>Open the shells, setting aside for use the deepest
ones. Have ready some melted butter, <i>not</i> hot, seasoned
with minced parsley and pepper. Roll each
oyster in this, letting it drip as little as may be, and lay
in the shells, which should be arranged in a baking-pan.
Add to each a little lemon-juice, sift bread-crumbs
over it, and bake in a quick oven until done.</p>

<p>Serve in the shells.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Oysters</span> (No. 2). <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 quart of oysters.</p>

<p>1 teacupful very dry bread-crumbs, or pounded cracker.</p>

<p>2 great spoonfuls butter.</p>

<p>½ cup of milk, or cream, if you can get it.</p>

<p>Pepper to taste.</p>

<p>A little salt.</p>

<p>Cover the bottom of a baking-dish (well buttered)
with a layer of crumbs, and wet these with the cream,
put on spoonful by spoonful. Pepper and salt, and
strew with minute bits of butter. Next, put in the
oysters, with a little of their liquor. Pepper them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
stick bits of butter in among them, and cover with
dry crumbs until the oysters are entirely hidden.
More pieces of butter, very small, and arranged thickly
on top. Set in the oven, invert a plate over it to keep
in the flavor, and bake until the juice bubbles up to the
top. Remove the cover, and brown on the upper grating
for two or three minutes—certainly not longer.</p>

<p>Send to table in the bake-dish.</p>

<p>This is a good intermediate course between fish and
meat, and is always popular.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled Oysters.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 quart of the finest, firmest oysters you can procure.</p>

<p>½ cup very dry bread-crumbs, or pounded crackers, sifted almost as fine as flour.</p>

<p>Pepper to taste.</p>

<p>½ cup melted butter.</p>

<p>Dry the oysters by laying them on a clean cloth and
covering them with another. Dip each in the melted
butter, which should be peppered, roll over and over in
the cracker-crumbs, and broil upon one of the wire
gridirons, made for this purpose, over a clear fire.
These wire “broilers” hold the oysters firmly, and can
be safely turned when one side is done. Five or six
minutes should cook them. Butter and pepper a hot
dish, lay in the oysters, and serve immediately.</p>

pepper-sauce), and lemon-juice. Let them lie in this
for ten minutes, turning them frequently; roll in the
crumbs, then in the beaten egg, again in the crumbs,
and fry in mixed lard and butter, made very hot before
the oysters are dropped in.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oysters in Batter.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of oysters.</p>

<p>2 eggs, whipped light.</p>

<p>1 cup of milk.</p>

<p>Flour to make a good batter.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Dry the oysters with a soft cloth, dip in the batter
twice, turning each one dexterously, that it may be
thickly coated, and fry in a mixture of butter and lard.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Oysters.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of oysters.</p>

<p>1 cup of milk.</p>

<p>Salt very slightly, and pepper to taste.</p>

<p>1 great spoonful butter.</p>

<p>Drain the liquor from the oysters into a saucepan
and heat to a boil. At the same time, put on the milk
to heat in another vessel set within a pot or pan of boiling
water. When the liquor in the saucepan boils up,
put in the oysters and stew until they begin to ruffle or
crimp at the edges. Stir in the butter, and when this
is quite dissolved, turn the stew into a tureen. Add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the milk immediately (which should be boiling hot),
cover closely, and send to table. Send around pickles,
or olives, and crackers with them. There is no danger,
when oysters are stewed in this way, of the milk curdling.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oyster Patés.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of oysters, minced fine with a sharp knife, with a thin blade,—not a “chopper.”</p>

<p>1 great spoonful butter “drawn” in a cupful of milk, or cream, if you can get it, and thicken with a teaspoonful of corn-starch or rice-flour, previously wet up with cold milk.</p>

<p>Salt and pepper to taste.</p>

<p>Drain the liquor from the oysters, and chop them as
directed. When the milk has been boiled and thickened,
and the butter well incorporated with it, stir in
the minced oysters, and stew about five minutes, stirring
all the while. Have ready some shapes of nice
pastry, baked, and fill with the mixture. Set in the
oven about two minutes to heat them well, and send to
table.</p>

<h4><i>Or,</i></h4>

<p>You can heat the chopped oysters in a very little of
their own liquor before adding to the thickened milk.
Unless you are sure that the latter is quite fresh, this is
a prudent precaution.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Oyster Pie.</span></h3>

<p>Line a pie-plate with good puff paste; fill it with
slices of <i>stale</i> bread, laid evenly within it; butter that
part of the crust lining the rim of the dish, and cover
with a top crust. Bake quickly in a brisk oven, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
while still hot, dexterously and carefully lift the upper
crust. The buttered rim will cause it to separate easily
from the lower. Have ready a mixture of minced
oysters and thickened cream, prepared according to the
foregoing receipt, and having taken out the stale bread
(put there to keep the top crust in shape), fill the pie
with the oyster cream. Replace the cover, set in the
oven for two minutes, or until hot, and serve. This is
a nice luncheon dish, and not amiss for supper.</p>

<h2>BREAKFAST.<br />
————————</h2>


<p>He was a shrewd Cœlebs who restrained his loverly
impatience to throw himself, in unconditional surrender,
at the feet of his beloved, by the resolution to see
her first at the breakfast-table. It is to be regretted
that his admiring biographer has not recorded the result
of the experiment. Let us hope, for the sake of preserving
the “unities of the drama,” that Cecilia was “in
good form” on the momentous occasion; not a thread
ironed awry in bib or tucker; not a rebellious hair in
her sleek locks. Cœlebs—Hannah More’s Cœlebs—and
every other that I ever read or heard of, was a pragmatical
prig; the complacent proprietor of a patent
refrigerator, very commodious and in excellent repair,
but which ought never, even by his conceited self, to
have been mistaken for a heart.</p>

<p>Knowing you, my reader, as I do, I would not
insult your good sense by intimating that the husband
of your choice resembles him in any leading trait.
Being a sensible (and avowedly a fallible) man, therefore,
John does not expect you to appear at the breakfast-table
in the flowing robes and elaborate laces that
belong to the leisure hours of the day. If he does, he
should don dress-coat and white cravat to keep you
in countenance. He will not find fault with a neat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
<i>peignoir</i> (if it <i>be</i> neat), or a plainly-trimmed dress, or
a white apron before the same. He ought to look for,
and to see a clean collar put on straight and fastened
snugly at the throat, or a white ruffle and cuffs, or
wrist-ruffles, to correspond, and hair in irreproachable
order. I have seen women who called themselves
ladies, who could never find time to give their hair
what they called “a good combing,” until afternoon.
And time and patience would fail me, and I fear the
equanimity of your diaphragm as well, were I to attempt
even a partial recapitulation of the many and
disgustful varieties of morning toilettes, of which I
have been the unwilling spectator. You should hear
my John,—whose profession takes him into what the renowned
Ann Gale styles the “buzzom of families,” at
all sorts of unconventional hours,—dilate upon this
theme. Not invalid attire. When the work of wearing
the robe of flesh becomes a matter of pain and difficulty,
he must be indeed hypercritical who notes the
ill-fitting wrapper, or roughened hair.</p>

<p>“But the queens of the breakfast-table!” he says,
with lifted eyebrows. “The grimy chrysalids of the
afternoon butterflies! It is not a casual glimpse of Cinderella
on sweeping-day, or during house-cleaning week,
that I complain of; but my heart swells with sincerest
pity for the husbands before whose eyes the play is
enacted three hundred and sixty-five times every year;
to whom the elf-locks and collarless neck, the greasy,
lank, torn dressing-gown of dark calico appear as surely
and regularly as the light of each new day.”</p>

<p>I do not say that you should bring to the breakfast-table
a face like a May morning. I hate stereotyped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
phrases and stereotyped smiles. But try to look as gracious
as though a visitor sat between you and the gentleman
at the foot of the board. It is not always easy
to appear even moderately cheerful at breakfast-time.
An eminent physician told me once, as the result of
many years’ study and observation, that no woman
should be up in the morning more than an hour before
breaking her fast. My own experience has so far corroborated
the wisdom of the advice that I always strive
to impress upon my domestics, especially the not strong
ones, the expediency of eating a slice of bread and
drinking a cup of tea during the interval that must
elapse between their rising-hour and the kitchen breakfast.
I practise the like precaution against faintness
and headache, in my own case, when I have to give my
personal superintendence to the morning meal, or when
it is later than usual. But with all precautionary
measures, I believe “before breakfast” to be the most
doleful hour of the twenty-four to a majority of our
sex. In winter, the house is at a low temperature;
dressing, a hurried and disagreeable business; the
children are drowsy, lazy, and cross; John “doesn’t
want to seem impatient, but would like to have breakfast
on time, to-day, my dear, as I have an important
engagement.” While the mother, who has slept with
one ear quite open all night, and one eye half shut,
because she fancied, at bed-time, that baby’s breathing
was not quite natural, fights twenty battles with bodily
discomfort and spiritual irritability before she takes
her seat behind the coffee-urn, and draws her first long
breath at the beginning of the “blessing,” that reminds
her of the mercies, new every morning, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
are still hers. For all this, try womanfully to launch
John upon the day’s voyage with a smile and word of
cheer. Think twice before you tell him of the cook’s
indolence and stupidity, and the housemaid’s petulance.
In the hope that the nauseating pain in your
head may yield to a “good cup of tea”—(bless it, with
me, O my sisters, one and all!) it is as well to withhold
the fact of its existence from him. If he <i>will</i>
read the morning paper over his coffee, his cakes
growing cold meanwhile, and thereby obliges the cook
to bake twice as many as would be necessary for the
meal were all to partake of it at the same time, restrain
the censure that trembles on your tongue, and
chat merrily with the children. A silent, hasty breakfast
is one of the worst things imaginable for their
digestion and tempers.</p>

<p>You would often rather have “a comfortable cry”
in a corner than act thus, but persuade yourself bravely
that nine-tenths of your miserable sensations are hysterical,
and, therefore, ephemeral. If we women do
not know what the “morning cloud” is, nobody does.
Still, remember it “passeth away.”</p>

<p>If possible, let your eating-room be light and pleasant,—warm
in winter, breezy in summer. Not only
should the table be neat, orderly, and, so far as you
can make it so, pretty, but guard against what I have
mentally characterized, in some very grand <i>salles-à-manger</i>,
as the “workshop look”—the look that says
to all who enter—“This is the place where you must
eat.” There are tall beaufets with loads of plate and
glass, side-tables with reserves of implements for the
labors of the hour and place; pictures of game, fish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and fruit;—more eating;—and if the walls are frescoed,
more game, sheep and oxen, or, at the best,
hunting, seem to reassure the consumers of to-day
that there will be more creatures killed in season for
to-morrow’s dinner. Therefore, eat, drink and be
solemn while doing it, as befits the season and surroundings.
There is nothing like having a single eye
to business.</p>

<p>Do not fret yourself if your dining-room boasts
neither paintings nor frescoes. Throw open all the
shutters in the morning, and coax in every available
ray of sunlight. Press the weather into service to
adorn the repast. If fine, remark upon the blueness of
the sky and the enjoyment of the outer world in the
glory of the day. If stormy, make the best of home-cheer,
and promise something attractive as an evening
entertainment, should the weather continue wet, or
snowy. A canary-bird in the sunniest window is a
good thing to have in a breakfast-room if you like his
shrill warbling. A pot of English ivy, brave and
green, twisting over the face of the old clock, and festooning
the windows, is a choice bit of brightness in
the winter time. In summer, when flowers are cheap
and plentiful, never set the table without them if you
can get nothing more than a button-hole bouquet to lay
on John’s napkin. Insist that the children shall make
themselves tidy before coming to the table, whatever
may be the meal, even if they will meet nobody except
yourself there. Teach them early that it is a disgrace
to themselves and to you to eat with unclean hands and
faces. Inculcate, further, the propriety of introducing,
while at table, topics that will interest and please all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Let wrangling, fault-finding and recrimination be never
so much as named among them. These are little
things, but whatever detracts from the idea that the
family repast is a tri-daily festival, and should be
honored and enjoyed as such, is a wrong to those whose
happiness it is your mission to guard and maintain. A
wrong to health as to heart. Food swallowed in bitterness
of spirit engenders dyspepsia and bile as surely
as do acrid fruit and heavy bread. A sharp reprimand
will take away sensitive Mamie’s appetite, and a frown
between the eyes that, when serene, seem to John to
mirror heaven itself, will beget in his bosom that indescribable
sinking of heart we know as “goneness,”
which is yet not physical faintness.</p>

<p>I have jotted down these hints under the heading of
“Breakfast,” although most of them are applicable to
all meals, because, as a rule, people bring less keenness
of hunger to this than to any other. It is as if the
longest fast that separates our stated time of eating
from another were the hardest to break; as if we had
got out of the habit of desiring and receiving food. It
behooves us, then, as wise housewives, to make provision
against mortifying rejection of our viands by various
and artful devices to tempt the dull or coy appetite.
Especially should we study to avoid sameness in our
breakfast bills of fare; an easy thing to compass by a
moderate exercise of foresight and ingenuity on the
part of the housewife.</p>

<p>The American breakfast should be a pleasing medium
between the heavy cold beef and game pie of the
English and the—for our climate and “fast” habits
of life—too light morning refreshment of the French.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
That in order to accomplish these ends it is not necessary
greatly to increase the market bills of the household,
or the cares of the mistress, I have tried to prove
in these pages, while I have not deemed it well to
specify, in all cases, which are exclusively breakfast
dishes. Very many of those I have described might
appear with equal propriety at breakfast, at luncheon,
at what is spoken of in provincial circles as “a hearty
supper,” or as an <i>entrée</i> or side-dish at dinner.</p>

<h2>PATÉS.<br />
————————</h2>


<p>No form of meat, <i>entrée</i>, or made dish is more popular,
and, if rightly prepared, more elegant than the
<i>paté</i>. It is susceptible of variations, many and pleasant,
chiefly in the form of the crust and the nature of its
contents. The celebrated <i>patés de foie gras</i>, imported
from Strasbourg, are usually without the paste enclosure,
and come to us in hermetically sealed jars.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Paté of Sweetbreads.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Make a good puff paste, basting two or three times
with butter, and set in a cold place for at least half an
hour. The best <i>paté</i> covers I have ever made were
from paste kept over night in a cool dry safe, before it
was rolled into a sheet for cutting. When the paste is
crisp and firm, roll quickly, and cut into rounds about
a quarter of an inch thick. Reserving one of these
whole for the bottom crust of each <i>paté</i>, lay it in a
floured baking-pan, cut the centre from two or three
others, as you desire your <i>paté</i> to be shallow or deep,
and lay these carefully, one after another, upon the
whole one, leaving a neat round well, a little over an
inch in diameter, in the middle. Bake in a quick oven,
and when lightly browned, glaze by brushing each
over with white of egg and returning to the oven for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
minute. Make ready as many sweetbreads as you need
(two of fair size will make a good dish), previously
prepared by boiling fifteen minutes in hot water, then
made firm by plunging into very cold. Cut them into
slices, season with pepper and salt, put into a covered
saucepan with a great spoonful of butter and a <i>very</i>
little water, and simmer gently until tender all through.
Cut these in turn into very small squares, and mix
with less than a cupful of white sauce. Return to the
saucepan and heat almost to boiling, stirring carefully
all the time. Fill the <i>patés</i>, arrange upon a hot dish,
and send up at once.</p>

<h4><i>White Sauce for the above.</i></h4>

<p>1 small cupful of milk, heated to boiling in a custard-kettle, or tin pail set in hot water.</p>

<p>1 heaping teaspoonful corn-starch, wet with cold milk.</p>

<p>Salt and pepper to taste.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful butter.</p>

<p>A little chopped parsley.</p>

<p>Stir the corn-starch into the boiling milk until it
thickens well, then the butter and seasoning.</p>

<p>This mixture is useful in all similar preparations,
but should be a little thicker for oysters than for
meats.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Patés.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Line small <i>paté</i>-pans with good puff paste, let this
get crisp in a cool place, and bake in a brisk oven. Stir
minced chicken, well seasoned, into a good white
sauce, heat through, fill the shells, set in the oven to
brown <i>very</i> slightly, and serve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Or,</i></h4>

<p>Thicken the gravy left from the roast chicken with
browned flour, add to the minced meat the yolk of one
or two hard-boiled eggs, mashed fine; stir all together
in a saucepan until hot, and fill the paste-shells. This
is a brown mixture, and if not over-cooked, is very
savory.</p>

<p>The remains of cold fowls, of any kind of game, and
of veal, can be served up acceptably in this way. The
<i>patés</i> should be small, that each person at table may
take a whole one. If preferred, the paste can be cut
round, as before directed, and baked without the tins.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Patés of Fish.</span></h3>

<p>The cold remains of baked or boiled salmon, fresh cod or halibut.</p>

<p>Some good white sauce, richer than if intended for meat.</p>

<p>About one-fourth as much mashed potato as you have fish.</p>

<p>Yolks of two or three hard-boiled eggs rubbed to a paste with a spoonful, or so, of butter. This paste should be smooth and light.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt to taste, and a little chopped parsley.</p>

<p>Shells of good puff paste, baked quickly to a delicate brown and glazed with beaten egg.</p>

<p>Rub the sauce gradually into the mashed potato until
both are free from lumps. When mixed, beat together
to a cream. Season and stir in the fish (which
should be “picked” very fine) with a silver fork, heaping
it as you stir, instead of beating the mixture down.
Do this quickly and lightly, fill the shells, set in the
oven to heat through, and when smoking-hot draw to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the oven door, and cover with the paste of egg and butter.
A little cream may be added to this paste if it be
not soft enough to spread easily. Shut the oven-door
for two minutes, to heat the paste.</p>

<p>Serve the dish very hot, and send around sliced
lemon with it, as some persons like to squeeze a few
drops over the <i>paté</i> before eating.</p>

<p>Canned lobster and salmon are very good, thus prepared.
Smoked salmon can be made palatable for this
purpose by soaking over night, and boiling in two
waters.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Swiss Patés.</span></h3>

<p>Some slices of stale bread.</p>

<p>A little good dripping or very sweet lard mixed with the same quantity of butter.</p>

<p>Two or three eggs beaten light.</p>

<p><i>Very</i> fine cracker-crumbs.</p>

<p>Minced fowl or veal mixed with white sauce, and
well seasoned. Cut <i>thick</i> slices of stale bread—baker’s
bread is best—into rounds with a cake-cutter. With a
smaller cutter extract a piece from the middle of each
round, taking care not to let the sharp tin go quite
through the bread, but leaving enough in the cavity to
serve as a bottom to the <i>paté</i>. Dip the hollowed piece
of bread in the beaten egg, sift the pulverized cracker
over it, and fry in the dripping, or lard and butter, to a
delicate brown. Drain every drop of fat from it.
Arrange upon a hot dish when all are done, heap up
with the “mince,” and eat without delay.</p>

<p>Devilled crab or lobster is nice served in this style.</p>

<p>Bread <i>patés</i> are a convenience when the housekeeper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
has not time to spare for pastry-making. You can, if
you like, fry them without the egg or cracker; but
most persons would esteem them too rich.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stella Paté.</span></h3>

<p>3 cups minced veal or lamb—either roast or boiled. If underdone, it is an advantage, and if lamb be used, every particle of fat must be left out.</p>

<p>1 can French mushrooms, or a pint of fresh ones.</p>

<p>4 hard-boiled eggs cut into slices, and a sliced onion.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls melted butter, or a cupful strong veal, lamb or fowl gravy.</p>

<p>3 cups fine bread-crumbs soaked in a cup of milk.</p>

<p>2 raw eggs beaten light and mixed with the milk.</p>

<p>Fry the mushrooms brown in dripping, or butter,
with the onion, then chop rather coarsely. Work the
crumbs, milk and raw eggs into a thick, smooth batter,
with which line the bottom and sides of a well-greased
mould or baking dish. Within this put a layer of the
minced meat, seasoned to taste, wet with gravy or a
little melted butter, and lay sliced egg over it. Next
should come a layer of mushrooms, then another of
meat, and so on, repeating the order given above until
all your materials are used up, or the mould is full.
The upper layer should be of the soaked crumbs.
Cover closely and bake in a moderate oven half an
hour, or until the outer crust is well “set.” Then set
the mould, still covered, in a baking-pan half full of
<i>boiling</i> water. Keep in the oven, which should be hotter
than at first, fifteen minutes longer. Pass a thin
sharp knife around the inside of the mould to loosen
the <i>paté</i> from the sides, and turn out with care upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
hot flat dish. You should have a little brown gravy
ready to pour over it.</p>

<p>If veal be the only meat used in preparing this dish,
a layer of minced ham will improve the flavor.</p>

<p>If these directions be strictly followed, the <i>entrée</i>
will be pleasing to both eye and palate.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Paté of beef and potato.</span></h3>

<p>This is made according to the foregoing receipt, but
substituting for the bread-crumb crust one of mashed
potato beaten soft and smooth with a few spoonfuls of
cream and raw egg. In place of mushrooms, put a
layer of chopped potatoes (previously boiled), mixed
with a boiled onion also chopped. Season with beef
gravy, from which the fat has been skimmed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Imitation paté de foie gras.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Livers of four or five fowls and as many gizzards.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls melted butter.</p>

<p>A chopped onion.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful Worcestershire, or other pungent sauce.</p>

<p>Salt and white pepper to taste.</p>

<p>A few truffles, if you can get them.</p>

<p>Boil the livers until quite done, drain and wipe dry,
and when cold, rub them to a paste in a Wedgewood
mortar. Let the butter and chopped onion simmer together
very slowly at the side of the range for ten minutes.
Strain them through thin muslin, pressing the
bag hard to extract the full flavor of the onion, and
work this well into the pounded liver. Turn into a
larger vessel, and mix with it the rest of the seasoning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
working all together for a long while. Butter a small
china or earthen-ware jar or cup, and press the mixture
hard down within it, interspersing it with square bits
of the boiled gizzards to represent truffles. Of course,
the latter are preferable, but being scarce and expensive,
they are not always to be had. If you have them, boil
them and let them get cold before putting them into
the <i>paté</i>. Cover all with melted butter and set in a
cool, dry place. If well seasoned it will keep for a
fortnight in winter, but should be kept closely covered.</p>

<p>This <i>paté</i> is a delicious relish, and is more easily attainable
than would at first appear. The livers of a
turkey and a pair of chickens or ducks will make a
small one, and these can be saved from one poultry-day
to another by boiling them in salt water, and keeping
in a cool place. Or, one can often secure any
number of giblets by previous application at the kitchen
of a restaurant or hotel.</p>

<h4><i>Or,—</i></h4>

<p>A fair imitation of the foregoing dish can be made
from the liver of a young calf, with bits of the tongue
for mock truffles.</p>

<h2>CROQUETTES.<br />
————————</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">These</span> popular little <i>roulettes</i>, although comparatively
new to the tables of most private families in America,
hold their place well where they have been once introduced.
Like the <i>paté</i>, their name is Legion as regards
shape, nature and quality.</p>

<p>In a housewifely conversation with a lady a few
months since, the word “croquette” chanced to escape
me, and I was caught up eagerly.</p>

<p>“Now,” with an ingenuous blush, “do you know, I
was offered some at a dinner-party the other day, and
was completely nonplussed! I thought croquet was a
game.”</p>

<p>“Croq<i>uette!</i>” I interposed, making the most of the
final <i>t</i>, and <i>e</i>.</p>

<p>“The gentleman who sat next me said ‘cro<i>quay</i>,’
very plainly, I assure you. But never mind the name.
What are they made of? Hominy?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned I. “Or rice, or potato, or lobster,
crab, salmon, halibut, cod, chicken, turkey, duck, game,
veal, lamb, or beef. In short, of all kinds of fish,
flesh, fowl, and vegetable. The smaller varieties are familiarly
known to readers of cookery-books as ‘olives’
of meat, poultry, or game; the larger as <i>rissoles</i> or
<i>croquettes</i>, the largest as <i>cannelons</i> or <i>mirotons</i>.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good gracious!” uttered my overwhelmed friend.
“Before I would bother my brain with such puzzling
nonsense, I would set my family down to cold meat
three times a day three days in a week!”</p>

<p>I believed she meant what she said. But not the
less is it a “good” and a “gracious” thing for the
housewife to conjure out of such unconsidered and unsightly
trifles as the mutilated cold fowl from which
half the breast and both legs are missing, or the few
chops “left over,” or “that bone” of lamb or veal, or
three square inches of cold fish, a pretty <i>plat</i> for breakfast
or luncheon, of golden-brown croquettes, imbedded
in parsley, or in a ruby setting of pickled beets, that
shall quicken John’s flagging appetite, and call from
the little ones the never stale plaudit, “Mamma can
always get up something nice.”</p>

<p>“Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing
be lost,” is a text from which the thoughtful house-mother
may preach to herself, as well as to her servants.
That no opportunity of making home fairer,
and even one hour of the day a little brighter, be lost
or overlooked. That no possibility of proving her constant,
active love for the least of her flock be passed
by. These daily cares and hourly assiduities are the
rivets in the chain that binds her best beloved ones unto
<span class="smcap">The Family</span>. Lacking them, the relation, instituted
by law and continued by custom, has no stancher securities
than habit and convenience—a hay-rope that will
shrivel at the first touch of Passion, be rent by one
resolute wrench of Expediency.</p>

<p>“A serious view to take of croquettes?” do I hear you
say. Then hearken to something positive and practical.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Unpalatable food is not wholesome.</i> It may be
medicinal. Nothing forced upon an unwilling appetite,
and that does not gratify the palate, can impart
that freshness of animal spirit and vigor which we call
Life—spontaneous vitality. Indifferent fuel—green or
sodden wood, or slaty coal—may keep a fire from going
out. There is not begotten from these the leaping
flame that gladdens, while it warms. And cold meat
and bread, dried into sawdusty innutrition, should no
more form the staple of John’s meals, even three times
a week, than his grate be filled, on December nights,
with coke-dust and mica.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Croquettes.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Minced chicken.</p>

<p>About one-quarter as much fine bread-crumbs as you have meat.</p>

<p>1 egg, beaten light, to each cupful of minced meat.</p>

<p>Gravy enough to moisten the crumbs and chicken. Or, if you have no gravy, a little drawn butter.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt, and chopped parsley to taste.</p>

<p>Yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, rubbed fine with the back of a silver spoon, added to the meat.</p>

<p>Mix up into a paste, with as little handling as may
be. Nor must the paste be too wet to mould readily.
Make, with floured hands, into rolls, or ovate balls, roll
in flour until well coated, and fry, a few at a time, lest
crowding should injure the shape, in nice dripping, or
a mixture, half lard and half butter. As you take
them out, lay in a hot cullender, that every drop of fat
may be drained off. Serve in a heated dish, and garnish
with cresses or parsley.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Turkey, duck, and veal croquettes can be made in
the same manner. They are even nicer if dipped in
egg and cracker-crumbs before frying.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beef Croquettes.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Minced cold roast or boiled beef.</p>

<p>One-quarter as much potato.</p>

<p>Gravy enough to moisten meat and potato, in which an onion has been stewed and strained out. Season also with catsup.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt to taste, and a pinch of marjoram.</p>

<p>Beaten egg to bind the whole, and one or two more beaten in a separate bowl.</p>

<p>Powdered cracker-crumbs.</p>

<p>Mash the potatoes, while hot, very smooth, or, if cold
mashed potato be used, be careful that no lumps remain
in it. Mix in the meat, gravy, and one raw egg,
season, and form into the desired shape. Dip each croquette
in beaten egg, then roll in the cracker-crumbs,
and fry quickly to a light brown. Drain carefully,
and lay upon a hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Venison or Mutton Croquettes.</span></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Some slices of cold roast venison, or roast or boiled mutton—the lean only, if mutton be used—minced.</p>

<p>One-fifth as much stale bread, crumbed fine.</p>

<p>Some good gravy or drawn butter, thickened with browned flour.</p>

<p>Beaten egg for a <i>liaison</i>.</p>

<p>A pinch of mace, a very little grated lemon-peel, and chopped parsley to taste.</p>

<p>Some currant jelly, in the proportion of a small teaspoonful to each cup of gravy.</p>

<p>Stir the jelly well into the gravy, season and wet up
with this the meat and crumbs, add the beaten egg,
make into rolls, and flour these, or dip in egg and
cracker-crumbs before frying.</p>

<h4><i>A Nice Breakfast Dish</i></h4>

<p>May be made of these by piling them in the centre of
a flat dish, within a wall, about two inches high, of
mashed potato, moulded to fit the inside of the dish,
and browned in the oven. You had best use the
platter of a chafing-dish for this purpose, or one of
stone china. You can, if you like, brush the “wall”
over with beaten egg before setting in the oven. Have
ready some good, brown gravy, with a little currant
jelly stirred into it; also, a small glass of claret.
Thicken with browned flour, boil up once, and pour over
the croquettes.</p>

<h4><i>Or,</i></h4>

<p>This is still nicer, if you add to the gravy some mushrooms,
previously fried in butter, and chopped up. If
you use these, you may, if you like, omit the potato
wall, garnishing the pile instead, with triangles of
fried bread.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fish Croquettes.</span></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Some cold fish—boiled, baked or fried—from which all fat, bones and skin have been removed, chopped fine.</p>

<p>One-third as much mashed potato, rubbed to a cream with a little melted butter.</p>

<p>A little white sauce, made of butter “drawn” in milk and thickened with corn-starch, and a beaten egg.</p>

<p>Chopped parsley, salt, pepper, and anchovy sauce, or walnut catsup, for seasoning.</p>

<p>Mix all well together, make into balls, which may
be rolled in flour, or in beaten egg, and then cracker-crumbs
before they are fried.</p>

<p>Send around sliced lemon with these, which are not
good unless eaten hot.</p>

<p>These are, as will be seen, a modification of the well-known
and time-honored “fish-ball,” but, if properly
made, will be found much better.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Croquettes of Lobster or Crab.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Meat of one fine lobster, or six crabs well boiled.</p>

<p>2 eggs.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls of butter.</p>

<p>½ cup fine bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful anchovy sauce.</p>

<p>Yolks of two eggs, boiled hard and rubbed to a powder, then beaten into the butter.</p>

<p>1 good teaspoonful lemon-juice.</p>

<p>Season well with salt and cayenne pepper; also, a pinch of mace and lemon-peel.</p>

<p>Yolks of two raw eggs, beaten very light.</p>

<p>Mince the meat, work in the butter—melted, but
not hot; then the seasoning, the raw eggs, and lastly,
the bread-crumbs. Make into oblong balls, and fry
quickly in sweet lard, dripping, or half lard, half
butter. Drain them of every drop of fat by rolling
each, for an instant, very lightly upon a hot, clean
cloth. Be sure your dish is well heated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>These are very delicious, and should be accompanied
by milk or cream crackers, with slices of lemon passed
to such guests as would like the additional relish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Croquettes of Game.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Remains of cold grouse, quail, etc.</p>

<p>Giblets of the same, or of poultry, boiled and cold.</p>

<p>Gravy.</p>

<p>One-fourth the quantity of fine bread-crumbs that you have of meat.</p>

<p>Season with pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Raw egg, beaten, for binding the mixture together, also some in a separate vessel for coating the croquettes.</p>

<p>Fine cracker-crumbs.</p>

<p>Mince the meat, and pound the giblets in a Wedgewood
mortar, when you have removed skin and cartilage
from the gizzards. Moisten with gravy as you
pound, until all are smooth. Mix into this the raw egg
and seasoning, then the meat, lastly the bread-crumbs.
Mould, dip in egg, then in cracker-powder and fry in
<i>boiling</i> fat. The dripping from roast poultry may be
used for this purpose. <i>Not</i> that from beef or mutton,
as it spoils the flavor of the game.</p>

<p>It is easy to reserve giblets for this dish by a little
foresight, and in no other shape are they more useful.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal and Ham Croquettes.</span></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Cold roast or stewed veal, the remnants of cutlets or chops, freed from bone, skin and gristle, and minced fine.</p>

<p>Half the quantity of cold boiled ham. A little fat on a slice, now and then, is an improvement.</p>

<p>Gravy or drawn butter thickened with browned flour to moisten the meat.</p>

<p>One-fourth as much fine bread-crumbs as you have meat.</p>

<p>Yolks of one or two eggs, boiled hard and powdered, then beaten into the gravy.</p>

<p>Season with chopped parsley and pepper. The ham usually supplies sufficient salt.</p>

<p>Beaten egg and powdered cracker.</p>

<p>Raw egg for the <i>liaison</i>.</p>

<p>Mix veal and ham well together; wet with the gravy
and season before putting in the raw egg. Stir up
well, but do not beat, and add the crumbs.</p>

<p>Boll in egg and cracker, and fry.</p>

<p>Mem. <i>The fat in which croquettes are fried must
be boiling, yet must not burn.</i></p>

<p>Try a bit of the mixture before risking the well-being
of your whole dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hominy Croquettes.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 large cups of fine-grained hominy, boiled and cold.</p>

<p>2 eggs, well beaten.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls melted butter.</p>

<p>Salt to taste.</p>

<p>Work the butter well into the hominy until the latter
is smooth and soft, then the eggs, beating hard for two
or three minutes with a wooden spoon, season, and
make into balls or rolls with floured hands. Roll each
in flour, and fry to a yellow-brown in sweet lard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Croquettes.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 cups mashed potato, cold and free from lumps.</p>

<p>2 eggs beaten to a froth.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful melted butter.</p>

<p>Salt and pepper to taste.</p>

<p>1 egg beaten in a separate vessel.</p>

<p>1 teacupful cracker-crumbs.</p>

<p>Mix as you do hominy croquettes, roll in egg and
cracker, and fry in boiling lard. Take up as soon as
they are done, and drain perfectly dry.</p>

<p>This is an excellent preparation of potato, and particularly
acceptable at breakfast or luncheon.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice Croquettes.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 cups cold boiled rice.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls melted butter.</p>

<p>3 eggs, beaten light.</p>

<p>A little flour.</p>

<p>1 raw egg and half a cup of powdered cracker.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls white sugar.</p>

<p>A large pinch of finely grated lemon-peel, and salt to taste.</p>

<p>Beat eggs and sugar together until light, and work
the butter well into the rice. Next, stir up with this
the beaten eggs. Season and make into croquettes
of whatever shape you may fancy. They are pretty,
moulded into the form of pears, with a clove blossom,
end outward, at the large end, and the stalk of another
projecting from the small, to represent the pear-stem.
You may find it advisable to use a little flour in working
the rice paste, but be careful not to get it too stiff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
in which event the croquette, of whatever composed,
ceases to be a delicacy. Roll in flour, then in the
beaten egg, lastly in the powdered cracker, and fry, a
few at a time, in sweet lard or butter.</p>

<p>Rice croquettes are sometimes eaten, with powdered
sugar sprinkled thickly over them, as a dessert, or sweet
sauce is served with them. They are delicious when
properly mixed and cooked.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cannelon of Veal.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 pounds of cold roast or stewed veal. The remains of a stewed and stuffed fillet are good for this purpose, especially if underdone.</p>

<p>1 pound cold boiled ham.</p>

<p>1 large cupful gravy. If you have none left over, make it of the refuse bits of the cold meat, such as fat, skin, etc.</p>

<p>1 small teaspoonful finely minced lemon-peel, the same of mace, and a table-spoonful chopped parsley.</p>

<p>Salt and pepper.</p>

<p>1 cupful bread-crumbs, dry and fine.</p>

<p>Yolks of 3 eggs beaten light, reserving the whites for glazing the cannelon when done.</p>

<p>Chop the meat very well, season it and stir in the
beaten yolks; wet with half the gravy, and mix in the
bread-crumbs. It should be just soft enough to handle
without running into a shapeless mass. Flour your
hands and make it into a roll about three times as long
as it is broad. Flour the outside well and lay it in a
greased baking-pan. Cover and set in the oven until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
it is smoking hot, when remove the cover and brown
quickly. Draw to the oven-door and brush over with
white of egg, shut the door for one minute to set this,
and transfer the cannelon, by the help of a cake-turner
or a wooden paddle, to a hot dish. Lay three-cornered
pieces of fried bread close about it, and pour a rich
gravy over all.</p>

<p>You can make a really elegant dish of this by adding
to the gravy a half-pint of sliced mushrooms, and
stewing them in it until they are tender and savory,
then pouring them over the <i>rouleau</i> of meat.</p>

<p>A savory and inexpensive dish, and a good <i>entrée</i> at
a family dinner. Of course you can vary the size to
suit the remnants of meat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cannelon of Beef</span></h3>

<p>Is made precisely like one of veal, except that
mashed potato is substituted for bread-crumbs, and an
onion is stewed in the gravy before the latter is strained
over the baked roll of meat.</p>

<p>Green pickles or olives are a palatable accompaniment
to it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Pretty Breakfast Dish</span></h3>

<p>May be made of croquettes of fish, lobster, fowl or
meat in the shape of hen’s eggs, heaped upon a dish
and surrounded by very thin strips of fried potato,
arranged to look as much as possible like straw. If
sauce is poured over the croquettes, be careful not to
let it deluge the potato that forms the nest.</p>

<h2>SWEETBREADS.<br />
————————</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is usually necessary to bespeak sweetbreads several
days in advance, as they are both scarce and popular.
But if your butcher be accommodating, and yourself
a valued customer, there is seldom much difficulty in
procuring enough to make a dish for a family of ordinary
size.</p>

<p>Keep sweetbreads in a cold, dry place, and cook as
soon as possible after getting them, as they soon spoil.
Be careful, moreover, in cooking them, to see that they
are thoroughly done.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Brown Fricassee of Sweetbreads.</span> (No. 1.) <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>4 sweetbreads.</p>

<p>2 cups brown veal gravy, strong and well-seasoned.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls of butter.</p>

<p>Pinch of mace, and twice as much cloves.</p>

<p>Browned flour for thickening.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful chopped onion, stewed in, and then strained out of the gravy.</p>

<p>Wash the sweetbreads carefully in warm water, removing
every bit of skin and gristle. Lay them in a
saucepan, and cover with <i>boiling</i> water. Boil them
ten minutes hard, turn off the hot water, and plunge
them instantly into very cold, in which you have dissolved
a little salt. Leave them in this about fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
minutes, or until they are cool, white and firm. Cut
each crosswise into slices nearly half an inch thick.
Have ready the butter in the frying-pan, and fry the
slices, turning frequently, until they are a good brown,
but do not dry them up. Drain off the fat through a
cullender, lay the sliced sweetbreads within a saucepan,
pour the hot brown gravy, already seasoned, over
them, cover closely, and simmer, not boil, fifteen minutes
longer.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Brown Fricassee.</span> (No. 2.) <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>4 sweetbreads.</p>

<p>2 cups good brown gravy—veal is best. Spice with mace and cloves.</p>

<p>1 onion.</p>

<p>½ cup butter.</p>

<p>1 pint mushrooms.</p>

<p>Prepare the sweetbreads by boiling and blanching
as in previous receipt. Slice the onion and mushrooms,
and fry quickly to a fine brown in half the
butter. Strain the fat from these, and return it to the
frying-pan, adding the rest of the butter. When hissing
hot, put in the sliced sweetbreads. Turn over and
over in the fat for three minutes. Meanwhile, let the
fried onions and mushrooms be stewing in the gravy.
Pour this gravy, when the sweetbreads are ready, into
a jar or tin pail with a closely-fitting top; set it in a
pot of boiling water, taking care there is not enough
to bubble over the top, put in the sliced sweetbreads,
cover, and stew <i>gently</i> at the side of the range for
twenty minutes—half an hour, should the sweetbreads
be large. Arrange the slices symmetrically upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
hot platter, pour the gravy over them, when you have
added a thickening of browned flour, and serve.</p>

<p>There is no more palatable preparation of sweetbreads
than this, especially if you add to the gravy a
glass of brown sherry. Garnish with triangles of
fried bread.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">White Fricassee of Sweetbreads.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>3 fine sweetbreads.</p>

<p>3 eggs.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls of cream.</p>

<p>1 great spoonful of butter.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful chopped parsley.</p>

<p>A good pinch of nutmeg.</p>

<p>1 cup strong veal or lamb broth—never mutton.</p>

<p>Wash the sweetbreads well. Soak them in very cold
or ice-water, slightly salted, for half an hour. Blanch
by plunging them for an instant into boiling water, after
which lay for five minutes in ice-water. This process
makes them white and firm. Put them into a covered
saucepan with the broth, which must be well seasoned
with pepper and salt, and, if you like, a very slight touch
of onion. Sprinkle with nutmeg, cover closely, and stew
steadily for an hour, if the sweetbreads are of a fair
size, and you mean to serve them whole. If they have
been sliced, three-quarters of an hour is sufficient.</p>

<p>Heat the cream in another saucepan until scalding
hot, but not boiling. Take it from the fire, and stir
carefully, a little at a time, into the beaten eggs. Just
before the sweetbreads are taken from the fire, add
this mixture slowly, stirring all the time. Leave it in
the saucepan just long enough to cook the eggs, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
do not let it boil. Stir in the parsley at the same time.
Turn out in a hot covered dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Larded Sweetbreads Stewed.</span></h3>

<p>3 fine sweetbreads.</p>

<p>¼ pound fat salt pork, cut into long narrow strips.</p>

<p>1 cup good veal gravy.</p>

<p>1 small pinch of cayenne pepper.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of mushroom catsup.</p>

<p>Juice of half a lemon.</p>

<p>Parboil the sweetbreads for five minutes. The water
should be boiling when they are put in. Plunge
immediately into very cold salt water. Let them lie
in this for five minutes, wipe them dry with a soft,
clean cloth, and lay upon a cool dish until perfectly
cold. Lard them closely with the strips of salt
pork. Stew gently for twenty-five minutes in the gravy,
which must be rich and thick. Add lemon-juice,
catsup, cayenne, and, if needed, a little salt. Lay the
sweetbreads in order on a flat dish, pour the gravy over
them, and garnish with sliced lemon laid in the triangular
spaces left between three-cornered bits of fried toast.</p>

<p>N.B. A pleasant addition to this dish, as to the brown
fricassee of sweetbreads, is force-meat of chopped beef
or veal very finely minced and worked to a paste
with hard-boiled yolk of egg, a little crumbed bread, a
spoonful or two of gravy or butter. Season very highly,
work in the beaten yolk of a raw egg to bind the
mixture, and make into oval balls a little larger than
olives. Flour these, and lay on a floured plate, so as
not to touch one another. Set in a quick oven until
they are firm and hissing hot, garnish the dish with them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
instead of the sliced lemon, and pour the hot gravy over
them and the triangles of toast as well as the sweetbreads.
An outer circle of parsley looks well with
these.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Larded Sweetbread—Fried.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>3 or 4 sweetbreads.</p>

<p>4 or 5 slices very fat salt pork.</p>

<p>A little pepper.</p>

<p>Parboil, blanch and lard, as in preceding receipt.
Have ready a clean, hot frying-pan barely greased with
a little butter. Put in the sweetbreads, and fry without
other fat than that of the pork lardoons which
should project half an inch on each side of the sweetbreads.
Cook steadily, turning the sweetbreads frequently,
until they are of a nice brown. Cut into one
with a small sharp knife, to assure yourself that it is
done. Remove to a hot, well-buttered dish, and garnish
with sprigs of parsley, which have been crisped, but
not burned, in a little boiling butter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled Sweetbreads.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Parboil and blanch, as already directed, by putting
first into hot water, and keeping it at a fast boil for
five minutes, then plunging into ice-cold, a little
salted. When the sweetbreads have lain in this ten
minutes, wipe them very dry, and with a sharp knife
split each in half, lengthwise. Broil over a clear, hot
fire, turning every minute as they begin to drip. Have
ready upon a deep plate some melted butter, well
salted and peppered, mixed with catsup or pungent
sauce. When the sweetbreads are done to a fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
brown lay them in this, turning them over several
times, and set, <i>covered</i>, in a warm oven.</p>

<p>Lay rounds of fried bread or toast within a chafing-dish,
and a piece of sweetbread on each. Pour the
rest of the hot butter, in which they have been lying,
over them, and send to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roasted Sweetbreads.</span></h3>

<p>3 sweetbreads.</p>

<p>1 cup brown gravy—veal, if you can get it.</p>

<p>2 eggs, beaten light.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls of butter, melted.</p>

<p>Large handful of bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful mushroom or tomato catsup.</p>

<p>1 small glass brown sherry.</p>

<p>A very little onion, minced fine, and stewed in the gravy.</p>

<p>Soak the sweetbreads in tepid water for half an
hour; then boil in hot water ten minutes, plunging
into very cold at the end of this time. Wipe perfectly
dry, coat with the beaten egg, then with the bread-crumbs.
Repeat this until they are thickly and closely
covered. Lay upon a baking-pan, put the butter, a
little at a time, over them, that it may soak into the
crumbs; set in a moderate oven, turn another pan over
them, and bake, covered, three-quarters of an hour, if of
fair size, basting from time to time with the veal
gravy. Dish them upon toast or fried bread, give the
gravy a boil-up when you have added the catsup and
wine, and strain it over the sweetbreads.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweetbreads Sautés au Vin.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>3 sweetbreads.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of butter.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful chopped onion and parsley, mixed.</p>

<p>1 cup brown gravy—veal or fowl.</p>

<p>1 glass brown sherry or fresh champagne.</p>

<p>Salt and pepper to taste.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful mushroom, or tomato catsup.</p>

<p>Parboil and blanch the sweetbreads, as usual; let
them get perfectly cold; cut lengthwise into slices
about a quarter of an inch thick. Have the butter hot
in a frying-pan, and lay them in. Cook ten minutes,
shaking, tossing and turning them all the while; then
add the gravy, catsup, onion, parsley and other seasoning
previously heated together. Shake all until they
have stewed and bubbled at boiling-heat for five minutes,
put in the wine, boil up once, and pour into a hot
dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>


<h3>KIDNEYS,</h3>

<p>Although less liked generally, are yet esteemed a
<i>bonne bouche</i> by the epicure whose appetite has been
educated by what is commonly styled “fancy” cookery.
They are cheaper than sweetbreads, and less
difficult to keep, if less delicate in flavor.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Kidneys.</span></h3>

<p>3 fine large kidneys—the fresher the better.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls of butter.</p>

<p>½ cup of good brown gravy—veal, mutton or beef.</p>

<p>A teaspoonful of chopped parsley, and half as much minced onion.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt to taste.</p>

<p>Skin the kidneys, and cut crosswise into round slices
a quarter of an inch thick. Roll them in flour.
Have ready in a frying-pan the butter well seasoned
with pepper, a little salt, the parsley and onion. When
it begins to simmer over the fire, lay in evenly and
carefully the slices of kidney. Fry gently for two
minutes, turn, and let them fry as long on the other
side, or until they are of a light brown. If cooked too
much, or too fast, they become tough and tasteless.
Remove instantly from the frying-pan with an egg-beater
or perforated skimmer, and arrange in order on
a hot dish. Add to the gravy in the pan, a few tablespoonfuls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
of broth, thicken with browned flour, boil up
once, and pour over the kidneys.</p>

<h4><i>Or,</i></h4>

<p>You can substitute for the butter in the pan three or
four table-spoonfuls of chopped <i>fat</i> salt pork. Let it
heat to hissing, put in the seasoning, stir up well and
fry the kidneys with the bits of pork. Then, proceed
according to the latter part of the foregoing receipt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Toasted Kidneys.</span></h3>

<p>3 kidneys skinned and split lengthwise, each into 3 pieces.</p>

<p>¼ pound of fat salt pork, cut into slices.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Slices or rounds of toasted bread from which the crust has been pared.</p>

<p>Lay the kidneys upon a <i>very</i> hot plate (a tin one is
best) in front of, and on a level with a clear brisk fire.
Toast the pork upon a fork, slice by slice, holding it
so that the gravy will drip upon the kidneys beneath.
When the pork is done, lay it upon another hot plate,
and set this in the place just occupied by the kidneys.
Toast these in their turn, so that the gravy which falls
from them shall drop upon the pork. Turn them frequently,
and be careful not to lose a drop of the gravy
from kidneys or pork. When the gravy ceases to flow
the kidneys are done. Serve upon the toast on a hot
dish; cut the pork into strips, and lay along the sides
of the dish. Pour the gravy over kidneys and toast.
This latter should either be fried previously in butter,
or be well buttered if toasted in the usual way. Pepper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and salt just before sending to table, as salt hardens
and toughens the kidneys.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Kidneys Stewed with Wine.</span></h3>

<p>3 kidneys.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls of butter.</p>

<p>1 onion, minced.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful mushroom, or walnut catsup.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls rich brown gravy.</p>

<p>1 glass of claret.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt to taste.</p>

<p>Cut the kidneys into round slices. Heat the butter
to a boil in a frying-pan, stir in the chopped onion, then
lay in the slices of kidney, and fry two minutes. Have
in another vessel the gravy, catsup and wine, ready
heated. Take up the kidneys, draining from them
every drop of fat, and transfer to this gravy. Cover
closely, stew gently for five minutes, or until tender,
and serve directly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled Kidneys.</span></h3>

<p>2 kidneys.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls of melted butter.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt, and a little chopped parsley.</p>

<p>Skin the kidneys carefully, but do not slice or split
them. Lay for ten minutes in <i>warm</i> (not hot) melted
butter, rolling them over and over, that every part may
be well basted. Broil on a gridiron over a clear fire,
turning them every minute. They should be done in
about twelve minutes, unless very large. Sprinkle
with salt and pepper, and lay on a hot dish, with a bit
of butter upon each. Cover and send up immediately.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Kidneys.</span></h3>

<p>3 kidneys.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls melted butter.</p>

<p>Juice of half a lemon, and a pinch of grated lemon-peel.</p>

<p>A very little mace, and pepper and salt to taste.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful chopped onion.</p>

<p>1 cup good brown gravy.</p>

<p>Cut each kidney lengthwise into three pieces; wash
these well and wipe dry. Warm the butter in a frying-pan;
put in the kidneys before this is really hot, with
the seasoning and gravy. Simmer all together, closely
covered, about ten minutes. Add the lemon-juice;
take up the kidneys and lay upon a hot dish, with fried
or toasted bread underneath. Thicken the gravy with
browned flour, boil up once, pour over all, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Kidneys à la Brochette.</span></h3>

<p>4 kidneys—those of medium size are preferable to large.</p>

<p>2 great spoonfuls of butter.</p>

<p>1 great spoonful chopped parsley, onion, and very fine bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>Juice of half a lemon.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt to taste.</p>

<p>Split the kidneys lengthwise, but not quite through,
leaving enough meat and skin at one side to act as a
sort of hinge. Rub them well inside with melted
butter, and lay them open, as you would small birds,
the back downward, upon a buttered gridiron, over a
bright fire. They should be done in about eight minutes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Turn often while broiling. Have ready the
stuffing of crumbs, parsley, onion, and butter, well
seasoned. Heat in a saucepan, stirring until smoking
hot. Add the lemon-juice; dish the kidneys, put some
of this mixture inside of each, close the two sides upon
it, butter and pepper them, and serve.</p>

<p>A few bits of fat salt pork, minced very fine, gives a
good flavor to the stuffing. The pork should have been
previously cooked.</p>

<h2>HASTE OR WASTE?<br />
————————</h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Ah!</span> you forget my sedan-chair,” said Madame de
Staël, when, at the height of her social and literary fame
some one wondered how she found time for writing
amid her many and engrossing engagements.</p>

<p>The sedan-chair was the fashionable conveyance for
ladies, at that day, in their round of daily calls or evening
festivities, and the brilliant Frenchwoman secured
within its closed curtains the solitude and silence she
needed for composition.</p>

<p>An American authoress who wrote much and with
great care—never sending her brain-bantlings into the
world <i>en déshabille</i>—replied to a similar question:
“My happiest thoughts come to me while I am mixing
cake. My most serious study-hours are those devoted
apparently to darning the family stockings.”</p>

<p>I entered a street-car, not many days ago, and sat
down beside a gentleman who did not lift his eyes
from a book he was reading, or show, by any token, his
consciousness of others’ presence. A side-glance at the
volume told me it was Froude’s “History of England,”
and I cheerfully forgave his inattention to myself. The
conductor notified him when he reached his stopping-place,
and, with a readiness that betrayed admirable
mental training, he came out of the world through
which the fascinating historian was leading him, pocketed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
his book, recognized me with a pleasant word,
and stepped to the pavement in front of his store, the
thorough business man.</p>

<p>“That is an affected prig,” said a fellow-passenger,
by the time the other had left the car. “He and I take
this ride in company every morning and afternoon. It
takes him half an hour to go from his house to his
store; and, instead of amusing himself with his newspaper,
as the rest of us do, he always has some heavy-looking
book along—biography, or history, or a scientific
treatise. He begins to read by the time he is
seated, and never leaves off until he gets out. It is in
wretched taste, such a show of pedantic industry.”</p>

<p>After this growl of disapprobation, the speaker buried
himself anew in the advertising columns of the <i>Herald</i>,
and I lapsed into a brown study, which had for its
germ the query, “Is it, then, more respectable, even
among men, to kill time than to save it?”</p>

<p>I knew the reader of Froude well. He was, as I
have intimated, a successful and a busy merchant; and
I had often marvelled at his familiarity with English
<i>belles-lettres</i>, and graver literature, the study of which
is usually given up to so-called professional men.
That hour a day explained it all. The crowded street-car
was his sedan-chair. I also knew his critic; had
seen him placed at such a woful disadvantage in the
society of educated men and women, that my heart
ached and my cheeks burned in sympathy with his
mortification; had heard him deplore the deficiencies
of his early training, and that the exigencies of his
business-cares now made self-improvement impracticable.
He would have protested it to be an impossibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
that he could find a spare hour a day to devote to the
neglected task; six hours a week—a whole day in a
month, two weeks in a year. Yet a fortnight of newspaper-reading
and idle gossip would be a sorry entry
in his year-book. For this lazy murder of time cannot,
by any stretch of conscience, be classed as healthful
recreation, any more than can the one, two, three,
ten hours a week during which Mrs. Neverthink sits
with folded hands, discussing fashions and her neighbors’
frailties, the while her work is steadily doubling
itself up, snowball-like, before the lever of each idle
minute. All work and no play would make Mrs. Neverthink
a dull and a diseased woman; but the fact is,
she is not playing any more than she is working, as she
sits, or stands to parley about trifles. She is only wasting
time, making inevitable the haste. Oh! these
“few words more,” with which the Neverthink tribe
prolong the agony of their would-be-if-they-could industrious
sisters, and heap up the burden of their own
coming cares! The words which mean nothing, the
driblets of a shallow, sluggish stream that meanders
into anybody’s meadow, and spreads itself harmfully
over the nearest pastures, instead of being directed into
a straight, beneficent channel! “I haven’t a bit of
system about me!” wails the worried creature, when
the ponderous snow-ball has finally to be heaved out of
the way by her own hands.</p>

<p>It would be a matter of curious interest could I recount
how often I have heard this plaint from those of
my own sex who are thus straining and suffering.
From some it comes carelessly—a form of words they
have fallen into the habit of repeating without much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
thought of what they mean. With a majority (I wish
I were not obliged to say it!) it is rather a boast than
a lament. The notable housekeeper who would be
ashamed to admit that she does not look narrowly after
paper and twine, bits of cold meat and scraps of butter,
does not calculate wisely concerning coal, candle-ends
and crusts—confesses, without a blush, that she takes
no thought of the gold-dust, known among us as minutes
and seconds, sifting through her lax fingers. By
and by, she is as truly impoverished as if she had
thrown away the treasure in nuggets, and then comes
the lament, not repentance. She is “run to death with
work, but she doesn’t see how it is to be helped. All
other housekeepers are the same. She never could
economize time; has no genius for arranging her
labors to advantage.”</p>

<p>The building of such an one is the heaping together
of boulders with crevices between, through which the
winds of disappointment whistle sharply. System,—by
which we mean a sagacious and economical apportionment
of the duty to the hour and the minute; an
avoidance of needless waste of time; a courageous
putting forth of the hand to the plough, instead of
talking over the work to be done while the cool morning
moments are flying,—“System,” then, is not a
talent! I wish I could write this in terms so strong
and striking as to command the attention, enforce the
belief of those whom I would reach. It is not a talent.
Still less is it genius. It is a duty! and she who
shirks it does herself and others wrong. If you cannot
order your household according to this rule, the fault
is yours, and the misfortune theirs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“We are living too fast!” is the useless note of
alarm sounded from press, and pulpit, and lecture-room;
echoed in a thousand homes, in various accents
of regret and dismay; most fearfully by the rattling
clods upon the coffin-lid, that hides forever the careworn
face of wife and mother, who has been trampled
to death by the press of iron-footed cares. Is not this
haste begotten by waste?</p>

<p>Is there any good reason why, in our homes—yours
and mine, my toiling sister—and in those of our neighbors
to the right and left of us, should not reign such
method as prevails in our husbands’ places of business?
Why, instead of meeting the morning with uplifted
hands and the already desponding cry, “I have so
much to do I cannot decide what to lay hold of first!”
we should not behold our path already mapped out by
our provident study over-night—its certain duties; its
probable stumbling-blocks; recreation, devotion and
rest—each in its proper place? Why we should not
be ready, “heart within and God o’erhead,” to make
the new day an event in our lives, a stepping-stone to
higher usefulness to our kind and toward heaven?
Why we should not bring to hindrance, as to duty, the
resolute, hopeful purpose with which the miner bends
over his pickaxe, the gardener over his spade, the
book-keeper over his ledger? Why, in short, we
should not magnify our office—make of housewifery,
and child-tending, and sewing a profession—to be
studied as diligently and pursued as steadily as are the
avocations of the other sex?</p>

<p>I should not dare ask these questions, were I not
already convinced, by years of patient examination of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the subject, that it is feasible for a clear-headed, conscientious
woman to do all this, and more. Would not
“dare,” because I know by what a storm of indignant
protest the queries will be met, not only from those
who pride themselves upon the amiable foible of
“having no system,” but on the part of deep-hearted
women who are really anxious to do their share of this
world’s great work.</p>

<p>The pale-faced mother over the way will tell me of
the clutch of baby-fingers upon her garments whenever
she essays to move steadily onward, and how the pressure
of the same holds her eyes waking through the
night-watches; how the weight of baby-lips upon the
breast saps strength and vitality together. Dear and
precious cares she esteems these; but they leave little
time or energy for anything else. The matron, whose
younglings have outgrown childhood, is ready with her
story of the toils and distractions of a family of merry
girls who are “in society,” and inconsiderate, unpunctual
“boys,” who look to “mother” to supply, for
the present, the place of the coming wife to each of
them. Martha, wedded and middle-aged, but childless,
is overpowered by cares, “put upon her by everybody,”
she relates, with an ever-renewed sense of
injury wearing into her soul, “because it is believed
that women without children have nothing to do.”</p>

<p>One and all, they are eloquent upon the subject of
unforeseen vexations, the ever-hindering “happenings”
that, like the knots tied in wire-grass across the path
by mischievous fairies, are continually tripping them
up.</p>

<p>“Moreover,” says Mrs. Practical, “there is little use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
in attempting to be methodical and to save the scraps
of time unless other people do. We are liable to have
our precious hoard stolen at any moment. If my
next-door neighbor persists in ‘dropping in’ whenever
she feels lonely, or wants a receipt, or has a morsel of
news she cannot keep, and cannot withdraw her unseasonable
foot from my house under an hour at each
visit, of what avail are my watchfulness and diligence?”</p>

<p>With her accustomed shrewdness, Mrs. Practical has
put her finger upon the hardest knot of the tangle.
Says that other model of sterling, every-day sense,
Miss Betsy Trotwood, touching Mr. Micawber’s difficulties:
“If he is going to be continually arrested, his
friends have got to be continually bailing him out—that
is all!”</p>

<p>The family of Neverthinks (“may their tribe <i>de</i>crease!”)
act upon the reverse principle. If their acquaintances
will be continually working themselves
into line with the flying hours, they—the Neverthinks—must
be zealous in pulling them to the rear. They
are like an army of mice scampering through the tidy
cupboards of Mesdames Practical and Notable. They
claim, like Death, all seasons for their own. Against
such there is no recognized law, and no redress except
in the determined will and wise co-operation of their
victims.</p>

<p>Dropping the fictitious personages, let us talk of this
matter plainly, as face-to-face, dear reader! Why
have women, as a class, such an imperfect conception
of the value of time to themselves and to others? To
Mrs. Trollope belongs, I believe, the credit of bringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
into general use a word which, if not elegant, is so expressive
that I cannot do without it in this connection.
Why do women <i>dawdle</i> away seconds and minutes and
hours in playing at work, or affecting to play? A
clever young girl was once showing me a set of chairs
embroidered by herself. Knowing that she was her
mother’s efficient aid in the cares entailed by a large
family, I asked her how she had made the time for the
achievement.</p>

<p>“O! I did it in the <i>betweenities!</i>” she returned,
gayly. “Between prayers and breakfast; between the
children’s lessons; between the spring and fall sewing;
between morning and evening calls, and in a
dozen other gaps. I had a piece of it always within
reach, and every stitch taken was a gain of one.”</p>

<p>We all need play—recreation, wholesome and hearty
diversion. I would guard this point carefully. God-willing,
we will talk of it, more at length, some time,
but to make the day’s work even and close, our life’s
work rich and ample, we must look well after the
“betweenities.”</p>

<p>Let me probe a little more deeply yet. Have not
the prejudices and gallantries of generations had their
effect upon the formation of feminine opinions on this
head? begotten in many minds the impression that we
are unjustly dealt with in being obliged to take up and
carry forward as a life-long duty any business whatsoever?
Is not the unspoken thought of such persons one
of impatient disappointment at finding that earth is not
a vast pleasure-ground and existence one long, bright
holiday? If men will speak of and treat women as
pretty playthings, they at least should not complain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
when the dainty toy proves to be an unserviceable domestic
machine. A man who acknowledges that he
dislikes the business by which he earns his living is
looked upon with instant distrust, as silly, indolent, or,
at the best, unphilosophical. If his auditor has occasion
to avail himself of the services of one of the craft to
which the unwilling workman belongs, he will assuredly
seek a man who would be likely to do himself
and his employer more credit than can be given by his
half-hearted labor. But housewives confess freely that
they loathe housekeeping and all pertaining thereto.
I speak that which I do know when I say that where
you find one who works <i>con amore</i> in her profession,
there are two who drudge on grumblingly, and consider
themselves aggrieved because the morning brings labor
and the evening care. The fault begins very far back.</p>

<p>“If girls knew when they were well off, they would
never marry.”</p>

<p>“A butterfly before marriage—a grub afterward.”</p>

<p>“Let well enough alone.”</p>

<p>“She who weds may do well. She who remains
single certainly does better.”</p>

<p>These are specimens of the choice maxims shouted
from the reefs of matrimony to the pleasure-shallops
gliding over the summer sea beyond the breakers. By
the time the boy begins to walk and talk, the sagacious
father studies his tastes and capacity in selecting a
trade for him; puts him fairly in training for the same
so soon as he is well embarked in his teens; sees for
himself that his drill is thorough and his progress satisfactory.
Of the lad’s sisters their mother will tell you,
with tears in her eyes, that she “cannot bear to tie the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
dear girls down to regular duties. Let them take
their pleasure now, for when they marry, trouble and
responsibility must come.”</p>

<p>Not seeing that to the unskilled apprentice the practice
of his art must be cruelly hard; that her own
loving hands are making tight the lashings of the load
which the tender shoulders must bear until death cuts
the sharp cords; that in her mistaken indulgence she
is putting darkness for light, and light for darkness;
bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Calf’s Liver</span> <i>à l’Anglaise</i>. <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 pounds fresh liver.</p>

<p>¼ pound fat salt pork.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls of butter.</p>

<p>1 small shallot, minced very fine.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful chopped parsley.</p>

<p>Cut the liver into slices half an inch thick. Lay
these smoothly in a saucepan in which the butter has
already been melted, but not allowed to get hot. Chop
the pork into very small bits, and spread upon the
liver. Sprinkle over this the minced parsley and onion,
and season to your fancy with salt and pepper. Cover
the saucepan closely, and set it where it will heat so
moderately that the juices will be drawn out without
simmering. Care must be taken to observe this direction
exactly, as both the tenderness and flavor of the
liver are impaired by stewing. At the end of an hour
and a half increase the heat gradually until the contents
of the saucepan begin to bubble. Remove from
the fire; arrange the liver neatly upon a hot chafing-dish,
and keep this covered while you boil up and
thicken with a little browned flour the gravy left in the
saucepan. Pour over the liver and serve.</p>

<p>This process renders calf’s liver tender and juicy to
a degree that would seem incredible to those who know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the much-abused edible only through the medium of
the usual modes of cookery.</p>

<p>Try it, when you are at a loss for something new, yet
not expensive.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Calf’s Liver</span> <i>au Domino</i>.</h3>

<p>2 pounds liver.</p>

<p>½ pound fat salt pork.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls of butter.</p>

<p>Seasoning of pepper, parsley and onion.</p>

<p>Cut the liver in pieces less than half an inch thick,
and rather more than an inch square. String these
evenly upon a slender skewer (an old knitting-needle
will do) alternately with bits of fat pork of the same
shape and width. When the skewer is full, lay for ten
minutes in the melted butter, season with pepper (the
pork salting it sufficiently), minced onion, and parsley,
then lay in a baking-pan, and cover with a tin plate or
shallow pan. Cook slowly in a moderate oven until
the pork begins to crisp. Remove to a hot dish, draw
out the skewer carefully, so as to leave the liver in the
form in which it was cooked; add a little hot water
and butter to the gravy, thicken with browned flour, boil
up once, and pour over the <i>dominoes</i> of pork and liver.</p>

<p>The sweetbreads, liver, heart, kidneys, and brains of a lamb. (Your butcher can easily procure all with timely notice.)</p>

<p>Handful of bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>1 raw egg, beaten light.</p>

<p>One small, young onion, minced.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful currant jelly.</p>

<p>Season with salt, pepper, and parsley.</p>

<p>1 cup good broth.</p>

<p>Parboil the sweetbreads for five minutes, then simmer
for ten in the gravy. Take them up, and set aside
to cool, while you boil the brains in the same broth.
When both brains and sweetbreads are cold and firm,
slice, dip in the egg, then the crumbs, and fry in good
dripping or butter. After the brains are taken from the
broth, put in the slices of heart, and stew very gently
for at least half an hour. Let them cool, then fry
with the minced liver in dripping seasoned with the
onion, minced fine. Slice the kidneys, and having
strained the useful broth from the liver, return it to
the saucepan, and stew the kidneys in it for five
minutes. Next, fry these for two minutes—no more—in
butter.</p>

<p>Arrange all in a hot dish; add to the fat left in the
frying-pan the broth, thicken with browned flour and
the jelly, season to taste, and pour over the sweetbreads,
etc.</p>

<p>You can make a larger stew—or fry—of calf’s sweetbreads,
liver, heart, and brains, and by most people
this would be relished more than the lamb ollapodrida.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to stew the various articles the day
before you mean to eat them, and have them all cold
to your hand, ready for frying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>2 pounds calf’s liver, cut into slices half an inch thick.</p>

<p>2 small young onions, minced.</p>

<p>1 small glass of sherry.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful mushroom or tomato catsup.</p>

<p>Salt, pepper, and parsley, with juice of a lemon.</p>

<p>Good dripping or butter for frying.</p>

<p>Slice the liver, when you have washed and soaked it
well, and fry it, turning often, to a light-brown. Drain
and lay in a hot chafing-dish. Mix with the dripping
or butter the onions, seasoning, lemon-juice, and browned
flour for thickening. Boil up, put in the catsup
and wine, heat almost to boiling again, and pour over
the liver.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricassee of Calf’s Liver.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 pounds liver, cut into strips more than half an inch thick, and as long as your finger.</p>

<p>2 young onions, minced.</p>

<p>1 glass wine.</p>

<p>Pepper, salt and parsley.</p>

<p>Butter or dripping for frying.</p>

<p>½ cup good gravy.</p>

<p>Dredge the sliced liver with flour, and fry to a light-brown,
quickly, and turning often. Mince the onions
and parsley, and heat them in the gravy in a saucepan;
put in the fried liver, let all stew together gently for ten
minutes, when pour in the wine, and as soon as this is
hot, serve—the liver piled neatly and the gravy poured
over it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Calf’s Liver</span> <i>à la mode</i>. <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 fine liver, as fresh as you can get it.</p>

<p>½ pound fat salt pork, cut into lardoons.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls of butter.</p>

<p>2 young onions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>1 table-spoonful Worcestershire or Harvey’s sauce.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls vinegar and a glass of wine.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful cloves.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful allspice.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful mace.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful sweet herbs, cut fine.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt to taste—very little of the latter, as the pork should salt it sufficiently.</p>

<p>Wash the liver in two waters and soak ten minutes
in cold water, slightly salted. Wipe dry, make incisions
in it about half an inch apart, and insert the
lardoons, allowing them to project slightly on each
side. Have ready in a frying-pan the sliced onion,
butter, sweet herbs and spice. Put in the liver and
fry to a good brown. Turn all into a saucepan, add
the vinegar and just enough water to cover the liver.
Cover closely, and simmer slowly an hour and a half.
Take out the liver and lay on a hot dish, add the wine
and sauce to the gravy, thicken with browned flour; let
it boil up once, pour about the liver, and send up the
surplus in a boat.</p>

<p>This is good cold as well as hot, cut in thin slices.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ragoût of Calf’s Head, or Imitation Turtle.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Half of a cold boiled calf’s head.</p>

<p>1 cup good gravy.</p>

<p>4 hard-boiled eggs.</p>

<p>About a dozen force-meat balls made of minced veal with bread-crumbs and bound with beaten egg, then rolled in flour.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful sweet herbs, chopped fine.</p>

<p>A very little minced onion.</p>

<p>Browned flour for thickening; pepper and salt for seasoning.</p>

<p>1 glass brown sherry.</p>

<p>Cut the meat of the calf’s head evenly into slices of
uniform size. Heat the gravy almost to a boil, with the
seasoning, herbs and onion. Put in the meat, simmer,
closely covered, for fifteen minutes; add the force-meat
balls, wine and the eggs sliced. Let all become
smoking hot; take up the meat; pile neatly on a hot
dish, lay the eggs on it; the force-meat balls at the
base of the heap, and pour a cupful of gravy over all,
sending up the rest in a boat.</p>

<p>This ragoût is very nice, and easily provided for by
setting aside enough meat for it, on the day you have
calf’s head soup, if the head be large.</p>

<p>It is also a cheap dish, as even a large head seldom costs
more than a dollar, and half will make a good ragoût.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ragoût of Calf’s Head and Mushrooms.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Half a cold boiled calf’s head, sliced and free from bones, also the tongue cut in round slices.</p>

<p>1 can French mushrooms (<i>champignons</i>).</p>

<p>1 onion sliced.</p>

<p>1 cup strong gravy—beef, veal, game or fowl.</p>

<p>Season with pepper, salt and sweet herbs.</p>

<p>Browned flour for thickening.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful mixed allspice and mace.</p>

<p>Juice of a lemon.</p>

<p>1 glass wine—claret or sherry.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls butter for frying, unless you have very nice dripping.</p>

<p>Drain the liquor from the mushrooms and slice them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Fry the slices of meat five minutes in the hot butter
or dripping. Take them out and put into a tin pail
or inner compartment of a farina kettle. Pour warm,
not boiling, water into the outer vessel, cover the inner
and set over the fire while you fry the mushrooms,
then, the onion, in the fat left in the frying-pan.
Drain them and lay upon the meat in the inner sauce-pan.
Have ready in another the broth, spiced and seasoned,
and now pour this hot upon the meat and mushrooms.
Cover closely and <i>simmer</i> for fifteen minutes.
Strain off the gravy into a saucepan, thicken; let it
boil up once; add wine and lemon-juice, and when it is
again smoking hot, pour over the meat and mushrooms
in a deep dish.</p>

<p>Some strips of fried toast are an acceptable addition
to this ragoût. These should be laid on the heap of
meat.</p>

<p>I have also varied it satisfactorily, by putting in
sliced hard-boiled eggs. It is a good <i>entrée</i> at dinner,
and a capital luncheon or breakfast-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Mould of Calf’s Head.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>A cold boiled calf’s head freed from bones and cut into thin slices—or so much of it as you need for your mould.</p>

<p>6 hard-boiled eggs—also sliced.</p>

<p>Five or six slices of cold boiled ham—corned is better than smoked.</p>

<p>1 large cupful of the liquor in which the head was boiled, stewed down to a rich gravy and well seasoned with pepper, salt, mace and minced onion. Strain before using.</p>

<p>Line the bottom of a buttered mould with the slices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of egg also buttered on the outer side, that they may
easily leave the mould.</p>

<p>Salt and pepper them, then fill the mould with alternate
layers of sliced calf’s head, ham, sliced eggs, seasoning,
etc., pouring in the gravy last. If you have no
top for the mould, make a stiff paste of flour and water
to close it in and preserve flavor and juices.</p>

<p>When done, set it, still covered, in a cool place.
When cold and firm, slice for luncheon or tea.</p>

<h4><i>Or,</i></h4>

<p>You can chop both kinds of meat fine, also the eggs,
and pack in successive layers within your mould.</p>

<p>A little lemon-juice and minced parsley, with a
touch of catsup, will improve the gravy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Calf’s Brains Fried.</span></h3>

<p>The brains, well washed, and scalded in <i>boiling</i> water for two minutes, then laid in very cold.</p>

<p>2 eggs well beaten.</p>

<p>A little flour and butter.</p>

<p>Salt and pepper.</p>

<p>Beat the brains, when perfectly cold, into a paste;
season, add the eggs and enough flour to make a good
batter, with less than a teaspoonful of butter to prevent
toughness. Have ready some good dripping in the
frying-pan, and when it is hissing hot, drop in the
batter in spoonfuls and fry.</p>

<h4><i>Or—</i></h4>

<p>You can fry on the griddle, like cakes.</p>

<p>They are very palatable either way when cooked
quickly and freed of every clinging drop of grease.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Calf’s Brains on Toast.</span></h3>

<p>The brains.</p>

<p>3 eggs, beaten light.</p>

<p>Salt, pepper and parsley.</p>

<p>Six or eight rounds of fried bread.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls butter.</p>

<p>Soak the brains fifteen minutes; free from skin and
fibre; then drop them into boiling water in which you
have put a little salt and a teaspoonful of vinegar.
Boil hard for ten minutes, then throw the brains into
ice-cold water. When well cooled break them up with
a wooden or silver spoon; and stir into the beaten eggs
with the seasoning. Have ready the butter in a hot
frying-pan, pour in the mixture and stir rapidly for
two minutes, or until it is a soft mass like stirred eggs.
Lay the toast upon a hot dish and heap the brains upon
it.</p>

<p>This dish is rendered yet more savory, if you will
pour some good well-seasoned gravy over the mounds
of brains and the toast.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal Cutlets</span> (<i>Stewed</i>). <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 pounds veal cutlets, nicely trimmed.</p>

<p>1 small onion, sliced.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls strained tomato sauce.</p>

<p>Enough butter or clear dripping to fry the cutlets.</p>

<p>Salt and pepper with a bunch of sweet herbs.</p>

<p>½ cup gravy.</p>

<p>Fry the cutlets to a light brown, but not crisp; take
them out and put into a covered saucepan. Have
ready the gravy in another, with the tomato sauce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
stirred into it. Fry the onion in the fat from which you
have taken the cutlets, and add with the fat to the gravy.
Pour all over the cutlets and simmer, covered, twenty
minutes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mock Pigeons.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>3 or 4 fillets of veal.</p>

<p>Force-meat of bread-crumbs and minced pork, seasoned.</p>

<p>½ cup mushrooms and a little minced onion.</p>

<p>1 sweetbread.</p>

<p>A dozen oysters.</p>

<p>½ cup strong brown gravy.</p>

<p>1 glass of wine.</p>

<p>Take the bone, if there be any, out of the fillets (or
cutlets, or steaks) of veal; spread each thickly with the
force-meat, and roll up tightly, binding with packthread.
Put into a baking-pan with enough cold water
to half-cover them; turn another pan over them and
bake from three-quarters of an hour to an hour in proportion
to their size. Meanwhile, boil the sweetbread
fifteen minutes, blanch in cold water; cut into dice,
and put into a saucepan with the gravy, which let simmer
on the hob. Cut the mushrooms into small pieces
and fry with the onion in a little butter, then add to
the heating gravy. In still another vessel, when the
veal is nearly done, heat the oysters, also chopped fine,
seasoning with salt and pepper. When the “pigeons”
are tender throughout, uncover, baste generously with
butter, and brown. Transfer to a hot flat dish; clip the
packthread and gently withdraw it, not to injure the
shape of the rolled meat. Let the gravy in which they
were roasted come to a fast boil, thicken with browned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
flour and pour into the saucepan containing the sauce,
sweetbreads, etc. Boil up once, add the wine; take
from the fire and put in the chopped oysters. Stir all
together well in the saucepan, pour a dozen spoonfuls,
or so, over the “pigeons,” taking up the thickest part;
send the rest to table in a gravy tureen.</p>

<p>You can make a simpler sauce by leaving out the
sweetbreads, etc., and seasoning the gravy in the baking-pan
with tomato sauce.</p>

<p>These “pigeons” will make an attractive variety in
the home bill of fare, and do well as the <i>pièce de résistance</i>
of a family dinner.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Veal Turnover.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Remains of roast veal—cold, minced fine, and seasoned.</p>

<p>2 or 3 eggs.</p>

<p>1 cup milk.</p>

<p>Flour to make a good batter—about 4 table-spoonfuls.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls of butter.</p>

<p>Chopped parsley, pepper, and salt.</p>

<p>Heat the butter to a boil in the frying-pan. Mix the
eggs, milk, flour, parsley, pepper, and salt into a batter,
and pour it into the frying-pan. Lay in the middle,
as soon as it begins to “form,” the minced meat. Fry
rather slowly, taking care that the batter does not burn.
When done on one side, fold the edges of the pancake
over to the middle, enclosing the meat, and turn with a
cake spatula. When both sides are of a delicate brown,
put the cake “turner” under it, and slip over to a hot
dish.</p>

<p>Send around a little gravy in a boat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Meat and Potato Puffs.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Slices of cold roast beef or mutton, and as many of corned ham.</p>

<p>2 eggs.</p>

<p>1 cup milk.</p>

<p>Enough potatoes and flour to make a good paste.</p>

<p>Pepper, salt, and mustard, or catsup.</p>

<p>Mash the potatoes, mix with them the eggs, well
beaten, and whip up to a cream, adding the milk gradually.
Add flour enough to enable you to roll it out
into a sheet. Cut into squares, and in the centre of
each lay a slice of beef or mutton, well seasoned with
pepper and salt, and spread with made mustard or catsup.
Lay on this a slice of ham of the same shape and
size; fold the paste into a triangular “turnover,” printing
the edges deeply with a jagging-iron, and fry in
butter or beef-dripping to a nice brown. Take up so
soon as they are done; lay on white paper for a moment
to absorb the grease, and serve hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Chicken.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Cold roast or boiled chicken—chiefly the white meat.</p>

<p>1 cup gravy.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful butter, and 1 egg, well beaten.</p>

<p>1 cup of fine bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Rid the chicken of gristle and skin, and cut—<i>not</i>
chop—into pieces less than half an inch long. Have
ready the gravy, or some rich drawn butter, in a saucepan
on the fire. Thicken it well, and stir in the
chicken, boil up once, take it off, and add the beaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
egg. Cover the bottom of a buttered dish with fine
bread-crumbs, pour in the mixture, and put another
thick layer of crumbs on top, sticking bits of butter all
over it. Bake to a delicate brown in a quick oven.</p>

<h4><i>Or—</i></h4>

<p>Instead of the gravy make a white sauce, as follows:</p>

<p>1 cup cream or rich milk.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls butter and 1 beaten egg.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful corn-starch, wet in cold milk.</p>

<p>Pepper, salt and parsley.</p>

<p>Heat the cream to a boil, stir in the corn-starch until
it thickens; then the butter, seasoning and egg. Take
at once from the fire, add the minced chicken, and
proceed as already directed.</p>

<p>Turkey may be used instead of chicken; also veal.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Beef</span> (<i>Very good</i>). <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Some minced beef or lean mutton.</p>

<p>1 young onion, minced.</p>

<p>½ cup gravy.</p>

<p>Some mashed potato.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of butter to a cup of potato.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of cream to the same.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Catsup, if mutton be used; made mustard for beef.</p>

<p>1 beaten egg for each cupful of potato.</p>

<p>Mash the potato while hot, beating <i>very</i> light with
the butter and cream—lastly, the egg. Too much attention
cannot be paid to this part of the work. Fill
a buttered baking-dish, or scallop shells with the
minced meat, seasoned with onion, pepper, salt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
mustard or catsup, moisten with gravy, and cover with
the mashed potato at least half an inch thick if your
dish be large. Smooth this over and bake to a light
brown. Just before you draw them from the oven glaze
by putting a bit of butter on the top of each scallop.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mince of Veal or Lamb.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 cup gravy, well thickened.</p>

<p>The remains of cold roast meat—minced, but not very fine.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls cream, or rich milk.</p>

<p>1 saltspoonful mace.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt to taste, with chopped parsley.</p>

<p>1 small onion.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful butter.</p>

<p>3 eggs well whipped.</p>

<p>Heat the gravy to a boil, add the milk, butter, seasoning,
onion, lastly the eggs, and so soon as these are
stirred in, the minced meat, previously salted and peppered.
Let it get smoking hot, but it must not boil.
Heap in the middle of a dish, and enclose with a fence
of fried potato or fried triangles of bread.</p>

<p>If well cooked and seasoned, this is a savory <i>entrée</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">White Fricassee of Rabbit.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 young rabbit.</p>

<p>1 pint weak broth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>¼ pound fat salt pork.</p>

<p>1 onion, sliced.</p>

<p>Chopped parsley, pepper and salt.</p>

<p>A very little mace.</p>

<p>1 cup of milk or cream.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful corn-starch or rice flour.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful butter.</p>

<p>Joint the rabbit neatly and cut the pork into strips.
Put on the rabbit to boil (when it has lain in salt-and-water
half an hour) in the broth, which should be cold.
Put in the pork with it, and stew, closely covered, and
very gently, an hour, or, until tender, before adding the
onion, seasoning and parsley. When you do this, take
out the pieces of rabbit, put in a covered dish to keep
warm and boil down the gravy very fast, for fifteen minutes.
Take out the pork, then strain the gravy through
your soup-strainer. Let it stand five or six minutes in
a cold place that the fat may rise. Skim this off; return
the gravy to the saucepan, and when it is almost
on the boil, stir in the cream or milk in which the corn-starch
has been dissolved. Stir until it thickens, put in
the butter, then the pieces of rabbit and the pork. All
must simmer together five minutes, but not boil. When
it is smoking hot, lay the rabbit neatly on a dish, pour
over the gravy, garnish with parsley and sliced lemons
and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Brown Fricassee of Rabbit</span>, <i>or</i> “<span class="smcap">Jugged Rabbit</span>.” <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 young but full-grown rabbit, or hare.</p>

<p>½ pound fat salt pork, or ham.</p>

<p>1 cup good gravy.</p>

<p>Dripping or butter for frying.</p>

<p>1 onion, sliced.</p>

<p>Parsley, pepper, salt and browned flour.</p>

<p>1 glass of wine.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful currant jelly.</p>

<p>Let the rabbit lie, after it is jointed, for half an hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
in cold salt-and-water. Wipe dry, and fry to a fine
brown with the onion. Have ready a tin pail, or the
inner vessel of a farina-kettle; put in the bottom a
layer of fat salt pork, cut into thin strips; then, one of
rabbit, seasoning well with pepper, but scantily with
salt. Sprinkle the fried onion over the rabbit, and
proceed in this order until your meat is used up.
Cover the vessel, and set in another of warm water.
Bring slowly to a boil, and let it stand where it will
cook steadily, but not fast, for three-quarters of an hour,
if the rabbit be large. Take out the meat, arrange it
on a dish, add the jelly, beaten up with the browned
flour, to the gravy, then the wine. Boil up quickly
and pour over the rabbit.</p>

<p>Do not fail to give this a trial.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Curried Rabbit.</span></h3>

<p>1 rabbit, jointed.</p>

<p>½ pound fat salt pork.</p>

<p>1 onion, sliced.</p>

<p>½ cup cream.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful corn-starch.</p>

<p>Pepper, salt and parsley, and 2 eggs well beaten.</p>

<p>1 dessert spoonful good curry-powder.</p>

<p>Soak the jointed rabbit half an hour in cold salt-and-water,
then put into a saucepan with the pork cut into
strips, the onion and parsley, and stew steadily, not
fast, in enough cold water to cover all, for an hour, or
until the rabbit is tender. Take out the meat and lay
on a covered chafing-dish to keep warm, while you
boil the gravy five minutes longer. Let it stand a few
minutes for the fat to rise, skim it and strain. Return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
to the fire; let it almost boil, when put in the
corn-starch. Stir to thickening, put in the curry-powder,
the rabbit and pork, and let all stand covered,
in a vessel of boiling water, fifteen minutes. Take up
the meat, pile upon the chafing-dish; add to the gravy
the cream and eggs, and stir one minute before pouring
over the meat. All should stand, covered, in the
hot-water chafing-dish about five minutes before going
to table.</p>

<p>No arbitrary rule can be given as to the length of
time it is necessary to cook game before it will be
tender, since there are so many degrees of toughness
in the best of that recommended by your reliable provision
merchant as “just right.”</p>

<p>Hence, my oft-reiterated clause, “or, until tender.”</p>

<p>You can curry chicken in the same manner as rabbit.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Devilled Rabbit.</span></h3>

<p>1 rabbit, jointed, as for fricassee.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls butter.</p>

<p>A little cayenne, salt and mustard.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful Worcestershire sauce, and 1 table-spoonful vinegar.</p>

<p>Parboil the rabbit, and let it get perfectly cold;
then score to the bone, the gashes about half an inch
apart. Melt together in a saucepan the butter and
seasoning. Stir up well, and rub each piece of the
rabbit with the mixture, working it into the gashes.
Broil over a clear fire, turning as soon as they begin to
drip. When they are brown lay on a hot dish, and
pour melted butter over them. Let them lie in this,
turning several times, for three or four minutes. Put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the rest of the mixture on them, if any be left, and
serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Devilled Fowl.</span></h3>

<p>Use only the legs and upper part of the wings of
roasted or boiled fowls. Treat precisely as you do the
rabbit in the foregoing receipt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salmi of Game.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>An underdone roast duck, pheasant, or grouse.</p>

<p>1 great spoonful of butter.</p>

<p>2 onions, sliced and fried in butter.</p>

<p>1 large cup strong gravy.</p>

<p>Parsley, marjoram and savory.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt.</p>

<p>A pinch of cloves, and same of nutmeg.</p>

<p>Cut your game into neat joints and slices, taking all
the skin off. Put refuse bits, fat, skin, etc., into a
saucepan with the gravy, the fried onions, herbs, spice,
pepper and salt. Boil gently one hour; let it cool
until the fat rises, when skim it off and strain the
gravy. Return it to the saucepan, and, when it heats,
stir into it the butter and thicken with browned flour.
Boil up sharply for five minutes and put in the pieces
of duck. After this, the salmi <i>must not boil</i>.
Neglect of this rule ruins most of the so-called salmis
one sees upon private as well as upon hotel tables. Set
the saucepan in a vessel of boiling water, and heat it
through, letting it stand thus ten minutes. Arrange
the meat upon a hot dish, and pour the gravy over it.
Garnish with triangles of fried bread, and serve a
piece to each guest with the salmi.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Rabbits.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>A pair rabbits.</p>

<p>½ pound fat salt pork, cut into thin slices.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls butter, and 1 glass of wine.</p>

<p>Bread-crumbs, chopped pork, parsley, grated lemon-peel, salt and pepper for the stuffing.</p>

<p>1 egg, beaten light, and 1 onion, sliced.</p>

<p>Skin and clean the rabbits (or hares), and lay in cold
salt-and-water half an hour. Prepare the dressing as
above directed, binding with the egg. Wipe the rabbits
dry inside and out, stuff with the prepared
mixture, and sew them up closely. Cover the backs
of the rabbits with the sliced pork, binding it in place
with packthread wound around and around the bodies.
Lay them in the baking-pan, backs uppermost; pour
into it about two cupfuls of cold water, cover closely,
and steam for an hour, raising the upper pan now and
then to pour a few spoonfuls of the boiling water about
the rabbits over their backs, that the pork may not
crisp; then remove the cover, clip the packthread,
and take off the pork. Brown the rabbits, basting
bountifully and frequently with butter. Chop the
pork, and crisp in a frying-pan with the sliced onion.
When the rabbits are done transfer to a hot dish; pour
the gravy into a saucepan with the pork and onion.
Boil up once, and strain before thickening with
browned flour. Add the wine, give a final boil, and
pour over and about the rabbits, sending up the surplus
in a tureen.</p>

<p>Pigeons and grouse are very fine roasted in this way,
also partridges.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Braised Wild Duck or Grouse.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>A pair of ducks or grouse.</p>

<p>1 onion, minced fine.</p>

<p>Bread-crumbs, pepper and salt, a pinch of sage, and a little chopped pork for stuffing.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls of butter, or good dripping.</p>

<p>1 cup gravy.</p>

<p>Browned flour.</p>

<p>Prepare and stuff the fowls as for roasting. Have
ready the butter or dripping hot in a large frying-pan,
and fry first one fowl, then the other in this, turning as
it browns below. Then lay them in a large sauce-pan
and pour the gravy, previously heated, in with them.
Cover closely and stew gently for an hour, or until the
game is tender. Transfer the fowls to a hot dish and
cover it, to keep in flavor and warmth while you strain
the gravy. Let it cool a little to throw up the grease.
Skim, thicken with browned flour, and boil up well
for five minutes. Skim again, put back the duck into
the gravy, and let all stand heating—<i>not</i> boiling—five
minutes more, before dishing. Pour a few spoonfuls
of gravy over the ducks on the dish; the rest into a
tureen.</p>

<p>Send around green peas and currant jelly with them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Quails.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>6 plump quails.</p>

<p>12 fine oysters.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls butter.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt, and fried bread for serving.</p>

<p>Clean the quails and wash out very carefully with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
cold water in which been dissolved a little soda.
Cleanse finally with pure water and wipe dry, inside
and out. Place within the body of each bird a couple
of oysters or one very large one, sew it up and range
all, side by side, in a baking-pan. Pour a very little
boiling water over them to harden the outer skin and
keep in the juices, and roast, covered, about half an
hour. Then uncover and baste frequently with butter
while they are browning. Serve upon rounds of fried
bread, laid on a hot dish. Put a spoonful of gravy
upon each, and send up the rest in a boat, when you
have thickened and strained it.</p>

<p>If you like, you may add a glass of claret and a
table-spoonful of currant jelly to the gravy after the
quails are taken up.</p>

<p>Be careful to sew up small game with fine cotton
that will not tear the meat when it is drawn out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricasseed Chicken</span> <i>à l’Italienne</i> (<i>Fine</i>).</h3>

<p>Pair of chickens.</p>

<p>½ pound fat salt pork, cut into strips.</p>

<p>2 sprigs of parsley.</p>

<p>1 sprig thyme.</p>

<p>1 bay leaf.</p>

<p>A dozen mushrooms.</p>

<p>1 small onion.</p>

<p>1 clove.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of butter.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of salad oil.</p>

<p>2 glasses wine—white, or pale sherry.</p>

<p>Cut the chickens into joints; put them with the pork
into a saucepan with a very little water, and stew,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
covered, until tender. Remove the chicken to a hot-water
chafing-dish and keep warm while you prepare
the gravy. Turn the liquor in which the chickens were
cooked into a frying-pan, thicken with browned flour;
put into it the herbs, onion, clove and the mushrooms
chopped very fine. Boil up sharply; add the butter
and stew fast half an hour. Then add the wine and
oil. Simmer a few minutes, and strain through a coarse
cullender over the chicken.</p>

<p>I have understated the merits of this admirable fricassee
by styling it “fine.” The dear friend upon whose
table I first saw it, will, I am sure, earn the thanks of
many other housewives, with my own, by giving the
receipt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Minced Chicken and Eggs.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Remains of roast or boiled chicken.</p>

<p>Stuffing of the same.</p>

<p>1 onion cut fine.</p>

<p>½ cup of cream.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful flour or corn-starch.</p>

<p>Parsley, salt, and pepper.</p>

<p>6 or 8 eggs.</p>

<p>½ cup gravy, and handful of bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>Cut the meat of the fowls into small, neat squares.
Put the bones, fat, and skin into a saucepan, with the
onion and enough cold water to cover them, and stew
gently for an hour or more. Strain, let it stand for a
little while that the fat may rise, skim, and return to
the saucepan. When hot to boiling, add the cream and
thickening, with the seasoning. When it thickens, put
in the chicken, after which it must not boil. Butter a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
deep dish; cover the bottom with the stuffing of the
fowls, crumbled or mashed up; wet with gravy; pour
in the mince; strew fine, dry bread-crumbs over this,
and break the eggs carefully upon the surface. More,
and if possible, finer crumbs should cover these; put a
bit of butter on each egg, pepper and salt, and bake in
a quick oven until the top begins to bubble and smoke.
The whites of the eggs should be well “set,” the yolks
soft.</p>

<p>I can safely recommend this receipt. Few “pick-up”
dishes are more popular with those for whom it is
my duty and delight to cater.</p>

<p>A mince of veal can be made in the same way, in
which case a little ham is an improvement, also two or
three hard-boiled eggs, cut into dice, and mixed with
the meat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Quenelles.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Some cold, white meat of fowls or veal.</p>

<p>1 cup fine bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls cream or milk.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls melted butter.</p>

<p>1 egg, well beaten.</p>

<p>1 cup well-flavored gravy.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Chop the meat very fine. Wet the crumbs with milk,
and drain as dry as you can. Work into this paste the
meat and egg, seasoning well. Flour your hands, and
make the mixture into round balls, rolling these in
flour when formed. Have ready the gravy hot in a
saucepan; drop in the quenelles, and boil fast five
minutes. Take them up and pile upon a hot dish;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
thicken the gravy with browned flour; boil up once
and pour over them.</p>

<h4><i>Or,</i></h4>

<p>After making out the quenelles, roll them in beaten
egg, then in cracker-crumbs, and fry in good dripping
seasoned with onion. Dry every drop of grease from
them by rolling them upon paper, and serve with the
gravy poured over them.</p>

<p>These quenelles are nice served up with fricasseed
sweetbreads, or as a garnish for them, or game.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rechauffée of Veal and Ham.</span></h3>

<p>Cold veal (if underdone all the better) and ham.</p>

<p>2 eggs, beaten light.</p>

<p>Handful of very fine bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>A little tart jelly.</p>

<p>Dripping or butter for frying.</p>

<p>Pepper, salt, and made mustard, or catsup.</p>

<p>Cut the veal and ham into rather thick slices of exactly
the same size. Spread one side of a slice of veal
with jelly, one side of the ham with mustard or thick
catsup. Press these firmly together, that they may
adhere closely, dip in the beaten egg, and roll in the
bread (or cracker) crumbs, which should be seasoned
with pepper and salt. Fry very quickly; dry off the
grease by laying them on soft paper, and pile upon a
dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roulades of Beef.</span></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Some slices of rare roast beef.</p>

<p>Some slices of boiled ham.</p>

<p>2 eggs, beaten light.</p>

<p>Butter or dripping for frying.</p>

<p>Pepper and mustard.</p>

<p>A little thick gravy.</p>

<p>Cut the beef into even, oblong slices, the ham rather
thinner and smaller. Spread one side of the beef with
mustard, and pepper the ham. Lay the ham upon the
beef and roll up together as tightly as possible; roll in
the egg, then the cracker, and pierce with a slender
steel, tin or wooden skewer in such a manner as to
keep the roll pinned together. Put several on each
skewer, but do not let them touch one another. Fry
brown; lay on a dish, and gently withdraw the skewers.
Pour the gravy boiling hot over them.</p>

<p>Small <i>roulades</i> are a convenient and toothsome garnish
for game and roast poultry.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roulades of Mutton.</span></h3>

<p>Can be made in the same way, but leaving out the
ham, and spreading the inside of each slice with currant
jelly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Chicken.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 tender young chicken, cut into joints.</p>

<p>2 eggs, beaten light.</p>

<p>½ cup of cracker-crumbs.</p>

<p>Sweet lard, dripping, or the best salad-oil for frying.</p>

<p>Lay the chicken in salt-and-water fifteen minutes;
wipe dry, pepper and salt, dip in the egg, then in the
cracker-crumbs, and fry slowly in hot lard or dripping.
Drain dry, pile on a hot dish, and lay sprigs of
parsley over it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Fried Whole.</span></h3>

<p>1 young, tender chicken, trussed as for roasting, but not stuffed.</p>

<p>Butter or <i>very</i> nice dripping for frying.</p>

<p>Clean the chicken, wash out well, and dry, inside
and out. Put it in your steamer, or cover in a cullender
over a pot of boiling water, keeping it at a fast boil
for fifteen or twenty minutes. Have ready the boiling
hot fat in a deep frying-pan, or cruller-kettle. It
should half cover the chicken, when having floured
it all over, you put it in. When one side is a light
brown, turn it. When both are cooked, take up, put
into a covered kettle or tin pail, and set in a pot of hot
water, which keep at a <i>slow</i> boil, half an hour. If you
like a delicate flavor of onion, put a few slices in the
bottom of the kettle before the chicken goes in.
Anoint the chicken plentifully, after laying it on a
hot dish, with melted butter in which you have stirred
pepper and chopped parsley.</p>

<p>This is a new and attractive manner of preparing
chickens for the table. None but tender ones should
be fried in any way.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">“Smothered” Chicken.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 tender chickens, roasting size, but not very large.</p>

<p>Pepper, salt and browned flour for gravy.</p>

<p>Clean and wash the chickens, and split down the
back as for broiling. Lay flat in a baking-pan,
dash a cupful of boiling water upon them; set in the
oven, and invert another pan over them so as to cover
<i>tightly</i>. Roast at a steady, but moderate heat, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
half an hour, then lift the cover and baste freely with
butter and a little of the water in which the fowls are
cooking. In ten minutes more, baste again with gravy
from the baking-pan. In five more, with melted
butter and abundantly, going all over the fowls,
which should now begin to brown. Increase the heat,
still keeping the chickens covered. A few minutes
before dishing them, test with a fork to ascertain if
they are tender. When done they should be of a
mellow brown hue all over the upper part—a uniform
and pleasing tint. Dish, salt and pepper them;
thicken the gravy left in the pan with browned flour,
adding a little water, if necessary, season with pepper,
salt and parsley, and send up in a gravy boat.</p>

<p>The flavor of “smothered” chicken—so named by
the Virginia housewife of the olden time—is peculiar,
and to most palates delightful.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Smothered Chicken with Oysters.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 fine, fat chicken.</p>

<p>1 pint of oysters, or enough to fill the chicken.</p>

<p>Dressing of chopped oysters, parsley and crumbs.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful butter.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls cream.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful corn-starch.</p>

<p>Yolks of 3 hard-boiled eggs.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt to taste, with chopped parsley for sauce.</p>

<p>Clean the chicken, washing it out with two or three
waters. Fill the “craw” with the prepared stuffing,
tying up the neck very securely. Then, pack the
main cavity of the body with oysters and sew up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
vent. Have ready a clean tin pail with a closely-fitting
top. Put the fowl, neatly trussed, into it, cover
and set in a pot of cold water. Bring to a boil, and
cook slowly for more than an hour after the water in
the outer vessel begins to boil. If the fowl be not
young, it may be needful to keep it in two hours. <i>Do
not open the inner vessel in less than an hour.</i> Having
ascertained that the chicken is tender throughout,
take it out and lay on a hot dish, covering immediately.
Turn the gravy into a saucepan, thicken with the corn-starch,
add the cream, parsley, seasoning and the
boiled yolks chopped fine. Boil up once; pour a
little over the chicken, and serve the rest in a sauce-boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fondu of Chicken or other White Meat.</span></h3>

<p>Some cold chicken, veal, or turkey minced fine.</p>

<p>1 cupful bread-crumbs—baker’s bread is best.</p>

<p>1 cupful boiling milk.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful butter.</p>

<p>1 slice cold boiled ham—minced.</p>

<p>½ onion boiled in, and then strained out of the milk.</p>

<p>2 eggs, beaten very light.</p>

<p>A pinch of soda, dissolved in the milk.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt to taste.</p>

<p>Soak the crumbs in the boiling milk, stir in the batter,
and beat very light. Let the mixture cool, while
you mince the meat and whip the eggs. Stir in the
meat first when the bread is nearly cold, season, and
lastly put in the beaten eggs. Beat all up well and
pour into a well-greased baking-dish. Set in a brisk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
oven. When the fondu is a light, delicately-browned
puff, send at once to table in the dish in which it
was baked.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Galantine.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>“A sort of glorified head-cheese—isn’t it?” said a
blunt collegian at the height of his vacation-appetite,
in passing his plate for a third reinforcement from the
dish in front of his hostess.</p>

<p>The phrase always recurs to me, when I taste or
see a galantine, for this was the foreign name of the
spicy relish aptly characterized by the youth. If spicy
and appetizing, it is also a convenient stand-by for
the lunch or supper-table, since it keeps well and
pleases most people, even those who do not affect “head-cheese”
proper.</p>

<p>A rind of fat salt pork, about six inches wide and eight long.</p>

<p>A little sausage, some minced ham, and odds and ends of game and poultry, with giblets of all kinds, chopped up.</p>

<p>Salt, pepper, cloves, allspice, mace and cinnamon; sweet marjoram, savory, thyme, a little grated lemon-peel; a pinch of cayenne.</p>

<p>1 small onion, minced very fine.</p>

<p>1 cup rich gravy, thick and savory.</p>

<p>A little butter and bits of fat meat cut into dice.</p>

<p>A pint of weak broth, seasoned with pepper, salt and onion.</p>

<p>Cut from a piece of fat salt pork (the loin or sides)
the rind in one piece, leaving on about a half-inch of
fat. Soak in water over night to make it more pliable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Spread, next day, upon a flat dish, and lay on it layers
of sausage (<i>or</i>, if you have it, potted ham or tongue),
game, poultry, giblets—minced meat of almost any
kind, although these named are most savory—well seasoned
with the condiments above enumerated, and
sprinkled sparsely with onion. Moisten as you go on,
with the rich broth; put in occasional bits of butter
and fat meat, else it will be dry. Fold all up in the
pork rind, joining the edges neatly.</p>

<p>About the roll wrap a stout cloth, fitting closely and
sew it up on all sides. Bind, for further security,
stout tape all about the bundle. Put the weak broth
into a pot, and while it is still cold, drop the galantine
into it, and boil slowly for five hours. The broth should
cover it entirely all the time. Let it get perfectly cold
in the liquor; then take it out, and without removing
tape or cloth, put it under heavy weights between two
plates, and do not touch it for twenty-four hours. At
the end of that time, cut tape and threads, remove the
cloth carefully, trim the ragged edges of the galantine,
and send to table whole. Cut as it is asked for, with
a keen knife, in smooth, thin slices.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jellied Tongue.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 large boiled tongue (cold).</p>

<p>2 ounces of gelatine dissolved in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>½ pint of water.</p>

<p>1 tea-cup of browned veal gravy.</p>

<p>1 pint of liquor in which the tongue was boiled.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful sugar.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful burnt sugar for coloring.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls of vinegar.</p>

<p>1 pint boiling water.</p>

<p>Put together the gravy, liquor, sugar, vinegar and
a table-spoonful of burnt sugar dissolved in cold water.</p>

<p>Add the dissolved gelatine and mix well—then the
boiling water, and strain through flannel. Cut the
tongue in slices as for the table. Let the jelly cool and
begin to thicken. Wet a mould with cold water, put a
little jelly in the bottom, then a layer of tongue, more
jelly, and so on, until the mould is full. Cover and set
in a cool place.</p>

<p>To turn it out, dip the mould in hot water for an instant,
invert upon a dish, and garnish with celery-sprigs,
and nasturtium-flowers. Cut with a thin, sharp
knife, perpendicularly.</p>

<p>This is a handsome and delicious dish, and easily made.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Game or Poultry in Savory Jelly.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>A knuckle of veal, weighing 2 pounds.</p>

<p>1 slice of lean ham.</p>

<p>1 shallot, minced.</p>

<p>Sprig of thyme and one of parsley.</p>

<p>6 pepper-corns (white), and one teaspoonful salt.</p>

<p>3 pints of cold water.</p>

<p>Boil all these together until the liquor is reduced to
a pint, when strain without squeezing, and set to cool
until next day. It should then be a firm jelly. Take
off every particle of fat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>1 package Coxe’s gelatine, soaked in</p>

<p>1 cup cold water for 3 hours.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful sugar.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls strained lemon-juice.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls currant jelly, dissolved in cold water, and strained through a muslin cloth.</p>

<p>Nearly a quart of <i>boiling</i> water.</p>

<p>Pour the boiling water over the gelatine, stir swiftly
for a moment; add the jellied “stock,” and when this
is dissolved, the sugar, lemon-juice and coloring. Stir
until all are mixed and melted together. Strain
through a flannel bag until quite clear. Do not shake
or squeeze the bag.</p>

<p>Have ready—4 or 5 hard-boiled eggs.</p>

<p>The remains of roast game, roast or boiled poultry,
cut in neat thin slices, with no jagged edges, and salted
slightly.</p>

<p>Wet a mould with cold water, and when the jelly
begins to congeal, pour some in the bottom. Cut the
whites of the eggs in pretty shapes—stars, flowers,
leaves, with a keen penknife. If you have sufficient
skill, carve the name or initials of some one whom you
wish to honor. Unless you can do this, however, content
yourself with smooth thin rings overlapping one
another, like a chain, when they are arranged on the
lowest stratum of jelly, which, by the way, should be a
thin one, that your device may be visible. Pour in
more jelly, and on this lay slices of meat, close together.
More jelly, and proceed in this order until
the mould is full, or all the meat used up.</p>

<p>Set in a cool place until next day, when turn out
upon a flat dish.</p>

<p>An oblong or round mould, with smooth, upright
sides, is best for this purpose.</p>

<p>There is no need for even a timid housekeeper to be
appalled at the suggestion of attempting a task such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
as is described above, or below. The very minuteness
with which I have detailed the by-no-means difficult
process should encourage, not daunt the tyro. “Nothing
venture, nothing have,” is a telling motto, in this
connection.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Tongue Jellied Whole.</span></h3>

<p>Make the jelly and stock as in preceding receipt,
leaving out the currant jelly, and coloring with a little
burnt sugar, dissolved in cold water. This gives an
amber tinge to the jelly. Should it not be clear after
first straining, run it through the bag—a clean one—again.</p>

<p>Trim a small tongue—boiled and perfectly cold—neatly,
cutting away the root and paring it skilfully
from tip to root with a sharp, thin-bladed knife. Wet
an oblong mould (a baking-pan used for “brick”
loaves of bread will do) with cold water, and put a
thin layer of the congealing jelly in the bottom. Upon
this lay the tongue, bearing in mind that what is the
bottom now will be the top when the jelly is turned
out. Encircle it with a linked chain made of rings of
white of egg, or, if you prefer, let the rings barely
touch one another, and fit in the centre of each a round
of bright pickled beet. The effect of this is very pretty.
Fill up the mould with jelly; cover and set in a cold
place for twelve hours.</p>

<p>This is a beautiful show-piece for luncheon or supper,
and when it has served the end of its creation in
this respect, can easily be carved with a sharp knife
and remain, even in partial ruin, a thing of beauty.</p>

<h2>GRAVY.<br />
————————</h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Presiding</span> over an establishment like this makes
sad havoc with the features, my dear Miss Pecksniffs,”
said Mrs. Todgers. “The gravy alone is enough to
add twenty years to one’s age. The anxiety of that
one item, my dears, keeps the mind continually upon
the stretch.”</p>

<p>Without following the worthy landlady further into
the depths of her dissertation upon the fondness of
commercial gentlemen for the “item,” I would answer
a question addressed to me by a correspondent who
“believes”—she is so kind as to inform me—“in
Common Sense.”</p>

<p>“I notice that many of your made dishes are dependent
for savoriness upon ‘a cup of good broth,’ or,
‘half a cup of strong gravy.’ Let me ask, in the spirit
of sincere desire for useful information, where is the
gravy or broth to come from?”</p>

<p>In return I plagiarize the words of a lady who accomplishes
more with less noise and fretting than any
other person I ever saw.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you find time for it all!” exclaimed
an admiring visitor.</p>

<p>“I <i>make</i> it, if I can get it in no other way,” was the
rejoinder.</p>

<p>Never throw away so much as a teaspoonful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
gravy of any kind. Season it rather highly, and set it
away in a cool place until it is wanted. For a while
you will have some difficulty in impressing the importance
of this rule upon your cook, especially if she
is allowed to have all the “soap-fat” she can save as
one of her “perquisites.” This is a ruinous leak in
any household, whether the oleaginous “savings” be
exchanged for soap (hard or soft), or for money. It is
so easy to “let it go into the fat-crock,” and when the
cook is to gain anything for herself by the <i>laisser-aller</i>
the temptation is cruelly strong—even if she have a
conscience. I have known the pile of unclean fat collected
for the soap-man to be swelled not only by the
bits of butter left upon the plates after meals, but by
quarter and half-pounds abstracted bodily from butter
tub or pot, and the abstraction never, in the phraseology
of the “conveyer,” to be “scrupled.” “The
wise convey it call!” said honest Pistol, and to no other
ethical motto has heartier response been made by the
comptrollers of culinary treasuries.</p>

<p>In a family of ordinary size nothing should find its
way into the buckets of the unsavory caller at basement-door
or back-gate. The drippings from most
kinds of roast meat, if settled, strained and skimmed,
and kept in a clean vessel, answer for many purposes
quite as well as butter, and better than lard. Even
that from mutton should be “tried out,” strained
through muslin, slightly salted, and, if you choose,
perfumed with rose-water, in which shape it is better
than cold cream, or glycerine for chapped hands, and
is a useful cerate for cuts, scratches, etc. The oil-cake
should be removed from the top of all gravies before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
they are used upon the table; for, be it understood,
<i>grease is not gravy</i>.</p>

<p>How often I have wished, from the depths of a
loathing stomach, that certain well-meaning housekeepers—at
whose boards I have sat as guest or boarder—who
fry beefsteak in lard, and send ham to table
swimming in fat; upon the surface of whose soups float
spheroids of oil that encase the spoon with blubber,
and coat the lips and tongue of the eater with flaky
scales—that these dear souls who believe in “old-fashioned
cookery,” understood this simple law of
digestive gravity!</p>

<p>A “rich gravy,” or “a strong broth,” is not of necessity,
then, one surcharged with fat. Beef-tea—which
is the very essence of the meat, and contains more
nourishment in small bulk than any other liquid used
in the sick-room—should be made of lean, but tender
beef, and every particle of suet be removed from the
cooled surface before it is re-heated for the patient’s
use.</p>

<p>If you have no gravy ready when you wish to prepare
ragoût, or other dish requiring this ingredient,
“make it.” Crack up the bones from which you have
cut the flesh, and put them into a saucepan with the
refuse bits of meat, gristle, skin, etc.; cover with cold
water, and stew very gently until you have extracted
all the nourishment, and from two cups of liquid in
the pot when the boiling commenced, you have one
cup of tolerable gravy. A few minutes of thought
and preparation in your kitchen after breakfast will
enable you to have anything of this kind in season for
a luncheon dish, or an <i>entrée</i> at the early dinner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Foresight in these matters is to be forearmed. Teach
your cook, furthermore, never to toss “that carcass”
of fowl, or the ham, or mutton-bone, “with next to
nothing upon it,” to the dogs, or into the scavenger’s
barrel. It will not, by itself, make good soup, unless
it be very much underdone, and even then the broth
will not be equal to that made from raw meat or marrow
bones. But, seasoned and thickened—adding
sweet herbs and a dash of catsup to the flavoring—it
will be useful as gravy in many ways; always remembering
that it must be skimmed before it is used.
It is also well worth your while to see for yourself,
when the meat comes home from market, that it has
been properly trimmed for the table. Much goes into
the oven or upon the spit to be roasted, or upon the
gridiron to be broiled, that is unfit to be eaten after it
has been baked or grilled. All bits of tough skin—all
gristly portions, soft bones, and the cartilage known as
“whitleather” should be removed before cooking from
roasts, chops, and steaks, when this can be done without
injuring the shape of the meat. The place for these is
the stew-pot. Cover them with cold water; put in
no seasoning until they have simmered slowly for a
long time in a close vessel, and the liquid is reduced to
at most one-half of the original quantity; then season,
boil up once hard, strain, and set aside until you want
to try a receipt in which “a little good gravy” is a
desideratum.</p>

<p>If you buy meat for gravy—which you need not do
very often, if you (and your cook) are reasonably careful
about “scraps,” cooked and raw—get the coarser
pieces and marrow-bones pounded to bits. Cut up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the meat fine, also. You cannot, by never so long boiling;
extract the strength so completely from a solid
“chunk” of flesh as from the same quantity shred
into strips or cut into dice. It should be reduced to
rags for gravies and soups, and invariably put on in
<i>cold</i> water. Fast boiling hardens the meat and injures
the flavor of the gravy. For the first hour, it should
barely simmer. After that, stew very slowly and
steadily. The best gravy is like jelly when cold.</p>

<p>Are these details trivial to absurdity? If they seem
so to you, pray bear with my over-carefulness when I
tell you how ignorant I was of minute economies
when I assumed the name, and, so far as I could, the
duties of a housewife, and how many others I have
seen and talked with who are as anxious as was I, to
stop the deadly little drains from the domestic system,
yet know not where to begin.</p>

<h2>SALADS.<br />
————————</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> subject has been treated of so fully—so exhaustively,
I thought, then,—in No. 1 of the “Common
Sense Series,”<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> that I have comparatively few receipts
to set down here. I can, however, heartily endorse
these as especially good of their kind. Indeed, the
neatest compliment ever paid any receipt in my <i>répertoire</i>
was when an epicure—not a <i>gourmande</i>—styled
the oyster salad made in obedience to it, an “inspiration.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oyster Salad.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 quart oysters, cut—not chopped—into small pieces.</p>

<p>1 bunch celery, cut—not chopped—into small pieces.</p>

<p>2 hard-boiled eggs.</p>

<p>2 raw eggs, well whipped.</p>

<p>1 great spoonful salad oil.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful powdered sugar.</p>

<p>1 small spoonful salt.</p>

<p>1 small spoonful pepper.</p>

<p>1 small spoonful made mustard.</p>

<p>Half cup best cider vinegar.</p>

<p>Drain the liquor well from the oysters and cut them
with a sharp knife into dice. Cut the celery, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>should be white and crisp, into pieces of corresponding
size. Set them aside in separate vessels, in a cold
place while you prepare the dressing. Beat the eggs
light (with a “Dover” egg-beater, if you have one),
mix in the sugar; then whip in gradually the oil until
it is a light cream. Have ready, rubbed to a powder,
the boiled yolks; add to <i>them</i> the salt, pepper, and
lastly the mustard. Beat these into the oil and yolk,
and then, two or three drops at a time, the vinegar,
whipping the dressing briskly, but lightly for two or
three minutes. It should, if properly managed, be like
rich yellow cream—or custard.</p>

<p>With a silver fork toss up the oysters and celery together
in a glass dish; pour half of the dressing over
them; toss up—not stir it down—for a minute, and
pour the rest on the top.</p>

<p>Lay a border of light-green celery tufts close within
the edge of the bowl, with a cluster in the middle of
the salad. Serve as soon as may be, after it is mixed.
Meanwhile, keep on the ice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cabbage Salad.</span> (<i>Very good.</i>) <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 small firm head of cabbage—chopped or sliced fine.</p>

<p>1 cup of sweet milk, boiling hot.</p>

<p>A little less than a cup of vinegar.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful butter.</p>

<p>2 eggs, well beaten.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful white sugar.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful essence of celery.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt to taste.</p>

<p>Heat the milk and vinegar in separate vessels. When
the vinegar boils, put in the butter, sugar and seasoning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Boil up once and stir in the chopped cabbage.
Heat to scalding, but do not let it actually boil. To
the hot milk add the eggs; cook one minute after they
begin to thicken. Turn the scalding cabbage into a
deep bowl; pour the custard over it, stir in quickly,
tossing up the mixture with a silver fork, until the ingredients
are thoroughly incorporated; cover to keep
in the strength of the vinegar, and set where it will
cool suddenly.</p>

<p>Serve perfectly cold, and garnish with some slices
of cold boiled eggs and cresses.</p>

<p>This will be found a vast improvement upon the
old-fashioned “coldslaw,” however prepared, and is
more wholesome.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lobster Salad—without Oil.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 fine lobster—boiled thoroughly, and carefully
picked out. Cut into small pieces; put in a broad dish,
and sprinkle with a teaspoonful of salt and one of pepper.
Set aside in a cold place.</p>

<p>2 bunches of white crisp celery, also cut into small
pieces. Toss up lightly with the lobster.</p>

<h4><i>Dressing.</i></h4>

<p>2 large table-spoonfuls of butter.</p>

<p>1½ large table-spoonfuls of flour or corn-starch.</p>

<p>1 pint boiling water.</p>

<p>Stir the flour, previously wet, into the boiling water;
let it boil two minutes and add the butter. Boil one
minute longer and set aside to cool. Meantime, mix
well and smoothly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>1 large table-spoonful of mustard.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful of sugar—(powdered).</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful boiling water.</p>

<p>1 small cup of vinegar.</p>

<p>Beat this up well, then add to the drawn butter—beat
to a cream and pour over the lobster.</p>

<p>Garnish the dish with celery tops and hard-boiled eggs.</p>

<p>It gives me great pleasure to present this receipt to
those who, from prejudice or taste, do not like the
presence of salad oil in any dish. I have known many
who would not knowingly partake of salad, fricassee, or
ragoût, that had oil, in however small quantity, as one
of its ingredients. And, unlike mince-pie, with the
brandy left out, or pie-crust, <i>minus</i> shortening, this oil-less
salad is really delicious. Especially if a couple of
raw eggs, well whipped, be added to the drawn butter,
when almost cold.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Salad.</span> (<i>Excellent.</i>) <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 full-grown chickens, boiled tender, and cold.</p>

<p>3 bunches of celery.</p>

<p>2 cups boiling water.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls corn-starch, wet with cold water.</p>

<p>1 great spoonful fat, skimmed from liquor in which the fowls were boiled.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls oil.</p>

<p>1 cup of vinegar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>2 teaspoonfuls made mustard.</p>

<p>3 raw eggs, whipped light.</p>

<p>3 hard-boiled eggs.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful powdered sugar.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful salt, or to taste.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful pepper.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful Worcestershire sauce.</p>

<p>Remove from the chicken every bit of fat and skin.
Cut the best portions of the meat into dice with a
sharp knife. Chopping is apt to make it ragged and
uneven in appearance. Cut the celery in like manner,
and set both aside in a cool place, when you have
strewed a little salt over the chicken. To the boiling
water add the corn-starch, and boil fast until it thickens
well. Then stir in the chicken-essence, skimmed
from the top of the cold liquor in which the fowls were
boiled. If the pot is clean, it will be of a fine golden
color. Take from the fire, and begin to whip into the
sauce the beaten eggs. Continue this until the mixture
is nearly cold. Rub the hard-boiled yolks to a
fine powder in a Wedgewood mortar or earthenware
bowl; add the mustard, sugar, pepper, and salt; the
Worcestershire sauce; then, a few drops at a time, the
oil, lastly, also gradually, the vinegar. Strain through
a wire sieve, or coarse tartelane, rubbing through all
that will pass the net. Put the chicken and celery together
in a glass salad-dish, and wet up with half of
the vinegar mixture. Be careful not to do more than
moisten it well, tossing up lightly with a silver fork.
Then beat the rest of the vinegar sauce into the thicker
mixture, which should by this time be perfectly cold.
Pour over the salad; ornament the centre of the dish
with flower-cups made of the hollowed halves of the
whites of boiled eggs, with celery-tufts for petals. Lay
a chain of sliced whites nearer the edge of the bowl,
with a tender-celery leaf in each link, and set in a very
cold place until wanted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>In obedience to this last injunction, I once left my
salad on the shelf of a “very cold” pantry, until it
was slightly frozen all through—a misadventure I did
not suspect until it came to table. With a desperate
attempt at facetiousness, I introduced the compound as
a novelty—“a <i>salade glacée</i>”—and, to my relief and
surprise, found in the accident a parallel to the “Irish
blackguard” snuff story. The spoiled dish was pronounced
by all far more delightful than the usual form
of salad. I do not advise a repetition of the adventure
on the part of any of my readers. Perhaps other
guests might be less complaisant and flattering. It is
hardly worth while to risk a cut glass dish on the
chances of success.</p>

<p>Use the liquor in which the chickens were boiled for
soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Dressing for Salad.</span></h3>

<p>1 cup sweet cream. It must be perfectly fresh.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful corn-starch, or very fine flour.</p>

<p>Whites of two eggs, beaten stiff.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls vinegar.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls best salad-oil.</p>

<p>2 tea-spoonfuls powdered sugar.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful (scant) of salt.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful pepper.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful made mustard.</p>

<p>Heat the cream in a farina-kettle almost to boiling;
then stir in the flour, previously wet with cold milk. Boil
for two minutes, stirring all the time; add the sugar,
and take from the fire. When half cold beat in the
whipped whites of egg with swift strokes, but not many.
Set aside to cool. When quite cold, whip in the oil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
pepper, mustard and salt, and if your salad is ready,
add the vinegar, and pour at once over it.</p>

<p>This dressing is especially nice for lettuce salad. If
made for chickens, only the white meat should be used.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Golden Salad-dressing.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>4 hard-boiled eggs.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls of best salad oil.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls vinegar.</p>

<p>Yolks of 2 eggs, well beaten.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful powdered sugar.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful essence of celery.</p>

<p>1 saltspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>1 saltspoonful pepper.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful made mustard.</p>

<p>Rub the boiled yolks to a powder; add sugar, mustard,
salt, pepper. Work up well with the oil; put in
gradually. Beat hard; stir in the vinegar, and strain
out all lumps, rubbing or squeezing the mixture to get
the full strength. Put over the fire and heat almost to
boiling. Take a spoonful at a time from the saucepan
while still on the fire, and beat into the whipped raw
yolks. When all the ingredients are mixed, return to
the saucepan; simmer slowly for three minutes, stirring
all the time. Do not let it boil, as it will be apt to curdle.
Put in the celery-essence after withdrawing it from
the range. Let it get perfectly cold; pile up lobster and
lettuce—the first cut into dice, the latter pulled lightly
apart—in a deep dish, and pour half the dressing over it.
Give a few tosses with a silver fork; mound up neatly,
and pour the rest of the sauce over all.</p>

<p>This dressing is very fine for a mayonnaise of fish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
In this case, add a teaspoonful of anchovy sauce after
it comes from the fire.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Salad Dressing.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 large boiled potatoes.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful powdered sugar.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful oil.</p>

<p>1 saltspoonful made mustard.</p>

<p>1 saltspoonful salt, and same of pepper.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful Harvey’s sauce.</p>

<p>1 egg, beaten light—white and yolk separate.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls vinegar.</p>

<p>Boil the potatoes until mealy, drain every drop of
water from them; let them dry on the range for an
instant, and <i>beat</i> up (not mash) them with a fork, tossing
them into lightness and dryness. When fine and
dry, beat in the salt, oil, and egg; the yolk first, then
the white, which should be a stiff froth. In another
vessel have ready mixed the mustard, sauce, sugar,
pepper, and vinegar. Add by degrees to the potato-mixture
until it is like thick cream. If not perfectly
smooth, rub through a coarse wire sieve or a bit of coarse
lace, such as is used for mosquito netting.</p>

<p>This, also, is peculiarly nice with salmon, or halibut
mayonnaise, although excellent with chicken or turkey
salad.</p>

<h2>VARIOUS PREPARATIONS OF
CHEESE.<br />
————————</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Toasted Cheese.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>½ pound cheese—dry—grated.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful butter.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful made mustard.</p>

<p>A pinch of cayenne pepper.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful very fine, stale bread-crumbs—soaked in cream.</p>

<p>Rounds or slices of thin toast, from which the crust has been pared.</p>

<p>Rub the bottom of a heated frying-pan with a cut
onion, then with butter. Put the cheese into it, stirring
fast to prevent burning. When it has melted,
put in the butter, the mustard, pepper; lastly the
bread-crumbs, which have been previously soaked in
cream, then pressed almost dry. Spread smoking hot
upon the toast, and eat at once.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cheese Toasted with Eggs.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>½ pound good English cheese.</p>

<p>3 eggs, beaten light.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls bread-crumbs, soaked in cream.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of mustard.</p>

<p>Salt and pepper to taste.</p>

<p>A little minced parsley.</p>

<p>Slices of delicate toast.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls butter—melted, but not hot.</p>

<p>Beat the soaked crumb into the eggs; the butter;
seasoning; lastly, the cheese. Beat very light; spread
smoothly on the toast and brown quickly upon the upper
grating of the oven. Be sure the bars are perfectly clean.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cheese with Macaroni.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>½ pound macaroni.</p>

<p>½ cup cream.</p>

<p>1½ table-spoonfuls butter.</p>

<p>Pepper, salt and parsley.</p>

<p>1 egg, beaten well, and 1 table-spoonful flour.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls grated cheese, and a little crumbed bread.</p>

<p>Break the macaroni into inch lengths; boil in
water slightly salted; drain <i>perfectly</i> dry in a cullender.
Take out two table-spoonfuls of cream, and put
the rest into a farina-kettle or saucepan, set within
another of boiling water. When it is scalding hot,
salt to taste; add half a table-spoonful of butter, then
the macaroni, and heat together slowly. They should
not boil. Meanwhile put the reserved cream into a
small saucepan. Heat, stir in the table-spoonful of
butter, pepper and parsley; the flour, wet with cold
milk, the grated cheese, and when this is dissolved, the
beaten egg. Pour the macaroni into a neat baking-dish,
cover with the cheese mixture. Strew the top
with <i>very</i> fine bread-crumbs, and brown quickly on the
upper grating of a hot oven.</p>

<p>This is very good.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cheese Fingers.</span></h3>

<p>Some good pie pastry, “left over” from pie-making.</p>

<p>3 or 4 table-spoonfuls best English cheese, dry and old—grated.</p>

<p>A little salt and pepper.</p>

<p>1 raw egg.</p>

<p>Roll the paste out thin; cut into strips about four
inches long and less than half as wide. Strew each
with grated cheese, season with pepper and salt, double
the paste upon it lengthwise, pinch the edges, and when
all are ready, bake in a quick oven. Wash over with
beaten egg just before taking them up, and sift a little
powdered cheese upon the top. Shut the oven-door an
instant to glaze them well; pile log-cabin-wise upon a
hot napkin in a warm dish, and eat at once, as they
are not good cold.</p>

<p>This will make a savory side-relish for John’s luncheon
on a hurried baking-day. Pastry is none the worse
for standing a day or longer in a cold, dry place, and
this uses up the “odds and ends” satisfactorily and
economically.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cheese Biscuits.</span></h3>

<p>Some pie-paste.</p>

<p>Grated cheese.</p>

<p>1 beaten egg.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Cayenne pepper, if you like.</p>

<p>Roll out the pastry thin; strew grated cheese, seasoned,
over the whole sheet and roll it up tightly. Roll
out again, even thinner than before; strew the rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
cheese; roll up and set in a cold place, half an hour,
until crisp. Roll again into a sheet, cut into squares
or triangles with a cake-cutter, or your jagging-iron;
prick with a fork, and bake very quickly in a hot oven.
Brush with beaten egg before taking up, and sift raspings
of cheese over the top, shutting up in the oven for
an instant to glaze the biscuits. Serve at once, on a
hot napkin.</p>

<p>These are, it will be seen, a modification of the
“fingers,” and will be preferred by some. Of course,
to those who object to cooked cheese as indigestible,
none of the combinations that smell so appetizing and
taste so savory, will be a temptation. Cayenne is said
to make these more wholesome.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cheese fondu.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /> (<i>Delicious.</i>)</h3>

<p>1 cup bread-crumbs—very dry and fine.</p>

<p>2 scant cups of milk—rich and fresh, or it will curdle.</p>

<p>½ pound dry old cheese, grated.</p>

<p>3 eggs—whipped very light.</p>

<p>1 small table-spoonful melted butter.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt.</p>

<p>A pinch of soda, dissolved in hot water and stirred into the milk.</p>

<p>Soak the crumbs in the milk; beat into these the
eggs, the butter, seasoning, lastly the cheese. Butter a
neat baking-dish; pour the <i>fondu</i> into it, strew dry
bread-crumbs on the top, and bake in a rather quick
oven until delicately browned. Serve immediately in
the baking-dish, as it soon falls.</p>

<p>The day on which this cheese-pudding first appeared
on my table is marked with a “very good.” It is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
pretty, cheap and palatable <i>entrée</i>, such as you need
never be ashamed to set before any guest, however
fastidious.</p>

<p>Let me say, in this connection, in explanation not
apology, for my running commentary upon receipts like
the above, that it is made—the commentary, I mean,
“with a purpose.” The unexpected guest is sometimes
an embarrassment, sometimes a horror to the inexperienced
housewife.</p>

<p>“I remembered the cold duck in the pantry with exceeding
joy; summed up the contents of bread and cake
box to a crumb, between the foot of the stairs and the
front-door,” confessed one to me. “By the time I had
said ‘How do you do?’ all around, and kissed the
babies, I remembered, with a sick thrill, that the butter
was low and the coffee out (we don’t drink it ourselves),
and that the whole party of new-comers must, at that
hour of the evening, be ravenously hungry.”</p>

<p>It is wise and provident to arm oneself against such
occasions by practice in the manufacture of what may
be called “surprise-dishes.” With a crust of cheese in
the larder, half a loaf of dry bread, an egg, a few
spoonfuls of milk and a bit of butter, one is tolerably
armed against an unlooked-for and unseasonable arrival.
Give the guest my <i>fondu</i>, with a good cup of coffee, or
tea, or glass of ale; bread-and-butter, cut thin, and your
brightest smile, and he will not complain, even inwardly,
should the cold duck be wanting.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Cheese.</span> (No. 1.)</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>3 pints of cream, with a teaspoonful of salt put in after it sours.</p>

<p>An empty salt-box, and ¼ yard of very stout, coarse lace.</p>

<p>Knock top and bottom out of one of the small boxes
used for holding table-salt, and cleanse the broad and
the narrow rims remaining, thoroughly. When dry,
fit over the bottom of the box itself a piece of new
strong net lace, or mosquito-netting. Fasten it in
place by pressing down over it the rim of the top. The
net should be drawn tightly and smoothly. Tack both
rim and net to the outside of the box with small tacks
driven through the former, leaving the heads protruding,
that they may be easily withdrawn. This is your
cheese-press. If you can get a small wire sieve with
<i>coarse</i> meshes, it will save you trouble. The cream
should have been set aside until it thickens or “loppers,”
in a solid curd. Inside of your mould lay a
piece of clean white tarletane, fitted neatly to the
sides and bottom, and projecting all around above the
press. Pour in the cream, opening the flakes gently
with a spoon to allow the whey to reach the bottom of
the press, but do not stir it. Set the mould upon two
slender sticks laid on a bowl, and let it drip two days.
If the mould will not hold all the cream, add it during
the first day, as the curd sinks. By the third day it
will be a rich, smooth mass. If not quite firm, trim
down the round board you took out of the top, cover
the cheese with a thin cloth, and press the board firmly
upon it. Lay a weight on this—not heavy enough to
break the net—and leave for some hours longer. A
saucer or small plate will do almost as well as
the board. When the cheese is ready to eat, which
will be when it is firm, remove the oil from the top by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
laying a piece of blotting or tissue paper upon it, and
lift from the mould by taking hold of the projecting
edges of cloth. It will be found very nice. This is
the famous English cream cheese.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Cheese.</span> (No. 2.) <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Make cottage cheese as directed in “Common Sense
in the Household,” page 268, or, what is easier, buy
two or three “pats” of the same from some honest
countrywoman in the market. To each little cheese
allow a table-spoonful of melted butter, and three or
four of good sweet cream, with a little salt and pepper.
Work in the butter first with a silver spoon, and very
thoroughly, then the cream, until all is light and
smooth. Make into neat rolls, or shape into miniature
cheeses upon a plate; print as you would butter, and
set in a cold place half an hour. They should be eaten
fresh.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cheese Patés.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Rounds of bread, cut and fried as for Swiss patés.</p>

<p>5 table-spoonfuls grated cheese.</p>

<p>½ cup hot water.</p>

<p>2 eggs, yolks only.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Handful bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of butter.</p>

<p>Put the water on the fire, and, when it boils, stir in
the butter and seasoning, the cheese, and, when this is
melted, the eggs. Heat together one minute; put in
the bread-crumbs and pour a good spoonful of the mixture
into each of the cavities left in the rounds of fried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
bread. Brown very quickly in the oven, and serve on
a folded napkin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cheese Sandwiches.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>¼ pound good English cheese—grated.</p>

<p>3 eggs, boiled hard—use the yolks only.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful melted butter.</p>

<p>Thin slices of buttered bread.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Rub the yolks to a smooth paste with the butter, season,
and work in the cheese. Spread the bread, and
fold upon the mixture.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ramakins.</span></h3>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls grated cheese.</p>

<p>2 eggs, beaten light.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful melted butter.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful anchovy sauce.</p>

<p>Pepper—cayenne is best.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful flour, wet with cream.</p>

<p>Rounds of lightly-toasted bread.</p>

<p>Beat the butter and seasoning in with the eggs; then
the cheese; lastly the flour; working until the mixture
is of creamy lightness. Spread thickly upon the
bread, and brown quickly.</p>

<p>This is a Dutch compound, but eatable despite the
odd name.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cheese Pudding.</span></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>½ pound dry cheese, grated fine.</p>

<p>1 cup dry bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>4 eggs, well beaten.</p>

<p>1 cup minced meat—one-third ham—two-thirds fowl.</p>

<p>1 cup milk and one of good gravy—veal or fowl.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful butter, and a pinch of soda in the milk.</p>

<p>Season with pepper and a very little salt.</p>

<p>Stir the milk into the beaten eggs, then the bread-crumbs,
seasoning, meat, lastly, the cheese. Beat up
well, but not too long, else the milk may, in spite of the
soda, curdle.</p>

<p>Butter a mould; pour in the pudding, cover, and
boil three-quarters of an hour steadily. Turn out upon
a hot dish, and pour the gravy over it.</p>

<h2>POTATOES.<br />
————————</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes à la Lyonnaise.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>12 potatoes, <i>parboiled</i>, and when cold, sliced, or cut into dice.</p>

<p>1 onion, chopped.</p>

<p>Butter or dripping for frying.</p>

<p>Chopped parsley, pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Heat the butter in a frying-pan; put in the onion;
fry one minute; then the potatoes. Stir briskly and
fry slowly five minutes. There should be butter enough
to keep them from sticking to the bottom of the pan;
and they should not brown. Add the seasoning just
before you take them up. Drain perfectly dry by
shaking them to and fro in a heated cullender. Serve
in a hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Potatoes.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>12 fine potatoes.</p>

<p>1 egg, beaten light.</p>

<p>1 great spoonful of butter.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful flour, wet with cold milk.</p>

<p>1 cup of milk.</p>

<p>Chopped parsley, salt and pepper.</p>

<p>Peel and lay the potatoes in cold water for half an
hour. Then slice or cut into dice into more cold water,
just enough to cover them. Boil gently in this until
tender; but not until they are a paste. Drain off nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
all the water; put pepper, salt, and the milk in with the
potatoes left in the saucepan, and heat again to boiling
before stirring in the flour. Cook two minutes, stirring
up from the bottom to prevent scorching; add the
egg, parsley and butter, and pour into a covered dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Potatoes.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>12 potatoes.</p>

<p>Butter or dripping for frying.</p>

<p>Salt to taste.</p>

<p>Peel the potatoes; cut from end to end in even strips,
by first halving, then quartering each; cutting into
eighths, and if the potato be large, into sixteenths.
The more regular the shape and uniform the size the
better the dish will look. Lay these in cold—ice-water
if you have it—for at least half an hour; then upon a
dry cloth, covering with another and patting the upper
gently to dry each piece. The butter or dripping
should be boiling hot. Fry the potatoes briskly, turning
as the lower side is done to a yellow-brown. As
you take them out of the fat—which should be done
the instant they are of the right color—put into a hot
cullender set over a plate in the open oven, and sprinkle
with salt. Serve in a napkin laid within a hot dish
and folded lightly over them. A dish-cover would
make them “soggy,” whereas they should be crisp.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>3 cups mashed potatoes.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls cream.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls butter.</p>

<p>Salt and pepper.</p>

<p>Yolks of four hard-boiled eggs.</p>

<p>1 raw egg, beaten well.</p>

<p>Handful dry, fine bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>Beat up the potatoes while hot, with the cream, butter
and raw egg, seasoning well. Put a layer in the
bottom of a buttered baking-dish; cover this with thin
slices of yolk, salt and pepper; then another layer of
potato, and so on, until all the materials are used up.
The top layer should be potato. Strew bread-crumbs
thickly over this. Bake covered until hot through,
then brown quickly. Serve in the baking-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes à l’Italienne.</span> (<i>Extremely nice.</i>) <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Enough mealy potatoes to make a good dish, boiled dry.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls of cream.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of butter.</p>

<p>Salt and pepper.</p>

<p>2 eggs, yolks and whites beaten separately.</p>

<p>Whip up the potatoes, while hot, with a silver fork,
instead of using the potato-beetle. This is, by the way,
a much better method of mashing potato than that
usually adopted. The potato is dried of all superfluous
moisture, made whiter and lighter than by pounding.
When it is fine and mealy, beat in the cream, the butter,
salt, pepper, and whip up to a creamy heap before
mixing in, with few dexterous strokes, the whites, which
should be first whipped stiff. Pile irregularly upon a
buttered pie-dish; brown quickly in the oven; slip
carefully, with the help of a cake-turner, to a heated
flat dish, and send up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes à la Duchesse.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>When you cook potatoes <i>à l’Italienne</i> prepare more
than will be needed for one day. Cut the remnants,
when perfectly cold, into squares or rounds with a
cake-cutter, wet in cold water. Grease the bottom of a
baking-pan and set these in it in rows, but not touching
one another, and bake quickly, brushing them all
over, except, of course, on the bottom, with beaten egg
when they begin to brown. Lay a napkin, folded, upon
a hot dish, and range these regularly upon it.</p>

<p>They are very fine, and considered quite a fancy
dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Eggs.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 cups cold (or hot) mashed potato.</p>

<p>¾ cup of cold ham, minced very fine.</p>

<p>2 eggs, beaten light.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful melted butter.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls cream or rich milk.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt, and dripping for frying.</p>

<p>1 cup good gravy.</p>

<p>Work the butter into the potato, the cream, seasoning,
and, when the mixture is free from lumps, the
beaten eggs. Beat all up light before the ham goes in.
Flour your hands; make this paste into egg-shaped
balls; roll these in flour and fry in good dripping;
turning them carefully, not to spoil the shape. Pile
upon a flat dish, and pour some good gravy, hot, over
them.</p>

<p>If you have nothing else of which gravy can be
made, boil the ham-bone or a few slices of ham in a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
water; thicken with flour; add a little butter, parsley,
pepper and a beaten egg; boil up until it thickens.</p>

<p>The above is a simple, but very good preparation of
potato. You will not grudge the little additional time
and trouble required to make pretty and palatable the
remnants of ham and potato, that, served plain, would
tempt no one except a very hungry man.</p>

<p>For many other ways of cooking this invaluable
vegetable, for breakfast and luncheon, as well as for
dinner, the reader is referred to the section—“Potatoes,”
in “Common Sense in the Household,” page 210.</p>

<h2>LUNCHEON.<br />
————————</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A young</span> friend of mine who had not long been a
wife and housekeeper, on returning from a morning
drive, one day, was met at the door by the intelligence
that her widower brother, who was a member of her
family, had brought three gentlemen home with him to
dinner. Her husband had not yet come in, and although
not naturally nervous, she repaired forthwith,
and in some trepidation, to the kitchen, to see for herself
that the early dinner, which was then customary in
the household, because more convenient for the master’s
business, was in satisfactory progress.</p>

<p>The range was hot and the top empty; the tables
clean and also empty; ditto the cook’s hands, while her
terrified face had the hue of her whitest dish-towel.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think, ma’am,” was her salutation, “that
the marketing has never come home at all, at all, and
not a bit of meat, nor so much as a pertater in the
house! Whatever will we do? and lashin’s of company
in onexpected!”</p>

<p>The mistress was equally dismayed when a glance at
the clock showed that it was past twelve. The
market-house closed at noon; her residence was out of
the region of butchers’ and green-grocers’ shops. It was
evident that the plethoric hamper, she had seen filled
by her usually careful provision merchant and left at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
his stand in the market to be delivered at her door
early in the forenoon, had miscarried, or been overlooked.</p>

<p>“Whatever shall we do?” The despairing cry rang
through her like a knell; a cold trembling seized her
limbs, and she dropped helplessly into a chair.</p>

<p>“Has nothing come, Mary? Not even the meat for
soup?”</p>

<p>“Sorra a sup, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Cannot you think of something that can be made
quickly? You told me you were a good hand at getting
up nice dishes at short notice!”</p>

<p>The Celt’s <i>pose</i> was tragic.</p>

<p>“An’ it was a thrue word I spake, whin I said it.
But an angel couldn’t make something out of nothing,
or it’s meself that would thry!”</p>

<p>Matters were too serious for the poor lady to suffer
her to smile at the implied assumption of angelic relationship.</p>

<p>“Something must be done, nevertheless,” she uttered,
desperately, and, with a woman’s instinct of leaning
upon rugged masculine strength when deserted by
feminine wit, she sought the billiard-room, whither the
inconsiderate brother had conducted his visitors, happily
unsuspicious as themselves of the poverty-stricken larder,
or the qualms that were racking the secretary of
the interior.</p>

<p>He showed an exasperatingly good-humored face at
the door in answer to her knock.</p>

<p>“Come in!” he said blithely, and would have flung
wide the door, but for the agonized gesture that beckoned
him into the entry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>In a whisper as agonized, she explained the situation.
He reflected a moment.</p>

<p>“Any pie, or cake in the house? fruit, fresh or preserved?”</p>

<p>“Yes, all,” impatiently. “But it isn’t a question of
dessert. There is literally nothing for <i>dinner</i>.”</p>

<p>“I understand! I have it! We’ll be fashionable for
once. Set on sardines, cheese, pie, cake, claret and sauterne,
and a dish or two of fruit. Make a royally strong
cup of coffee to wind up with, and <i>call it luncheon!</i>”</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes the guests were summoned to the
dining-room, where the pretty hostess, in a becoming
<i>demi-toilette</i>, welcomed them as the friends of her husband
and brother, and presided over the collation from
which not one of them perceived that anything was lacking,
like a gracious little queen. A lisp of apology
would have spoiled all, and she had tact enough to
avoid the danger.</p>

<p>“That man is a Napoleon in small matters!” said I,
when she told me the story. “If he never says another
good thing, his—‘Call it luncheon,’ should win him
lasting fame with all housekeepers who hearken to the
tale of his masterly strategy.”</p>

<p>I have given the anecdote at length, that the reader
may have the benefit of all the lessons it conveys.</p>

<p>First—Assure yourself, whenever it is practicable,
that the materials for dinner are in the house several
hours before the time for serving it arrives.</p>

<p>Secondly—It is a wise plan to keep sardines, canned
salmon and lobster, cheese, and potted meats on hand
always, with preserved fruits, and not to let the stores
of cake and crackers run too low.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Thirdly—There is scarcely an imaginable domestic
disaster on an ordinary scale, that cannot be rectified,
or, at least, modified into passableness by presence of
mind and energetic action. “Call it luncheon,” is a
capital motto in other and graver perplexities than the
non-arrival of a day’s marketing, and where higher interests
are concerned than the feasting or fasting of
half a dozen people.</p>

<h2>VEGETABLES.<br />
————————</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Egg Plant.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 fine egg-plant.</p>

<p>2 eggs.</p>

<p>½ cup milk.</p>

<p>A little salt.</p>

<p>Flour for thin batter, and lard, or dripping, for frying.
Slice and pare the egg-plant, and lay in salt-and-water
one hour. Wipe perfectly dry, make a batter
as directed above, dip each piece in it, and fry to a
fine brown. Drain dry, and serve on hot, flat dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mock Fried Oysters.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 bunch oyster-plant, or salsify.</p>

<p>2 eggs—well beaten.</p>

<p>½ cup milk.</p>

<p>Flour for thin batter, and lard or dripping for frying.</p>

<p>Pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Wash, scrape and grate the salsify, and stir into the
batter, beating hard at the last. It should be about as
thick as fritter batter. Season, and drop, by the
spoonful, into the hot fat. Try a little, at first, to see
if batter and fat are right. As fast as they are fried,
throw into a hot cullender, set over a bowl in the
oven. Send to table dry and hot.</p>

<p>They are delicious if eaten at once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>After twelve years’ trial of this receipt, I have come
to the conclusion that there is no better or more reliable
rule for the manufacture of corn-bread. In all
that time, there has hardly been a Sunday morning,
winter or summer, when the family was at home, on
which a loaf of this bread has not graced my breakfast-table,
and unless when, through negligence, it has
been slightly scorched or underdone, I have never
known it to come short of excellence.</p>

<p>In cutting corn-bread, do not forget to hold the
knife <i>perpendicularly</i>, that the spongy interior of the
loaf may not be crushed into heaviness. Very good
corn-bread is often ruined by neglect of this precaution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>3 cups white Indian meal.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls yeast.</p>

<p>1 cup flour.</p>

<p>1 quart scalding milk.</p>

<p>3 eggs, beaten to a froth, yolks and whites apart.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful white sugar.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful butter.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful salt.</p>

<p>Pour the milk boiling hot upon the meal; stir well
and leave until nearly cold. Then beat in gradually
the yeast, sugar and flour, and set in a moderately
warm place. It should be light enough in five or six
hours. Melt, without overheating, the butter and
lard; stir into the batter, with the salt, lastly the
beaten eggs. Beat all together three minutes; put in
greased muffin-rings; let these rise on the hearth for a
quarter of an hour, with a cloth thrown lightly over
them. Bake about twenty minutes in a quick, steady
oven, or until they are of a light golden-brown.</p>

<p>Send at once to table, and in eating them, <i>break</i>, not

<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Mush, to be Eaten with Milk.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart boiling water.</p>

<p>2 cups Indian meal.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls flour.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful salt.</p>

<p>Wet up meal and flour in a little cold water. Stir
them into the hot water, which should be actually boiling
on the fire when they go in. Boil at least half an
hour, slowly, stirring deeply every few minutes, and
constantly toward the last. Send to table in a deep
dish, but not covered, or the steam will render it
clammy.</p>

<p>Eat in saucers, with cream or milk poured over it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oatmeal Porridge</span> (<i>for breakfast</i>).</h3>

<p>1 quart boiling water.</p>

<p>2 scant cups best Scotch or Irish oatmeal, previously soaked over night in enough cold water to cover it well.</p>

<p>Salt to taste.</p>

<p>Stir the oatmeal into the water while boiling, and
let it boil steadily, stirring up frequently from the
bottom, for at least three-quarters of an hour. Send
to table in an uncovered deep dish, to be eaten with
cream, and, if you like, with powdered sugar.</p>

<p>This is a wholesome and pleasant article of food.
If you give it a place upon your regular bill of fare,
you would do well to provide yourself with a farina-kettle
expressly for cooking it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oatmeal Gruel</span> (<i>For Invalids</i>). <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 cups Irish or Scotch oatmeal.</p>

<p>2 quarts water.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful salt.</p>

<p>Set the oatmeal to soak over night in half the water.
In the morning strain through a coarse tartelane bag,
pressing through all the farinaceous matter that will
go. Add the rest of the water with the salt, and boil
down until it begins to thicken perceptibly. Let it
cool enough to become almost a jelly, and eat with
powdered sugar and cream.</p>

<p>It is very good for others besides invalids.</p>

<p>Enough milk to work into a soft dough.</p>

<p>1 saltspoonful salt.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful white sugar.</p>

<p>Rub the butter into the sifted flour. Beat the eggs
well with a cup of milk, and work into the flour, adding
more milk, if necessary, to make the dough of right
consistency. Stir the sugar into the yeast, and work
this into the dough with a wooden spoon, until all the
ingredients are thoroughly incorporated. <i>Do not knead
it with the hands.</i> Set to rise in a moderately warm
place until very light. Make into rolls lightly and
quickly, handling as little as possible. Set these in
rows in your baking-pan, just close enough together to
touch. Throw a cloth lightly over them, and set on
the hearth for the second rising, until they begin to
“plump,” which should be in about fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Bake half an hour in a steady oven. They are best
eaten hot.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>3 pints of flour, or enough to work into a soft dough.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of white sugar.</p>

<p>Warm the milk slightly, and add to it the beaten
eggs and salt. Rub the butter into the flour quickly
and lightly, until it is like yellow powder. Work into
this gradually, with a wooden spoon, the milk and eggs,
then the yeast. Knead well, and let it rise for three
hours, or until the dough is light and begins to crack
on top. Make into small rolls; let them stand on the
hearth twenty minutes before baking in a quick oven.
Just before taking them up, brush over with white of
egg. Shut the oven door one minute to glaze them.</p>

make a well in the middle, pour in the mixture, and
set aside in a moderately warm place until next day.
In the morning melt the butter, and add to the sponge;
work all together well, and let the dough rise six hours,
at least. Make into oblong rolls; range them in
baking-pan, at such a distance from one another that
they will not run together, and let them rise three
hours longer. Bake in a steady quick oven, glazing,
when done, with white of egg.</p>

<p>I have never tried this receipt myself, but having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>

<p>1 table-spoonful melted butter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rusk.</span> (No. 1.)</h3>

<p>1 quart flour.</p>

<p>3 cups milk, slightly warmed.</p>

<p>3 eggs—whites and yolks separate.</p>

<p>¾ cup of butter, rubbed with the sugar to a cream, and flavored with 1 saltspoonful nutmeg.</p>

<p>1 gill yeast.</p>

<p>Make a sponge of milk, yeast, and enough flour for
rather thick batter. Let it rise over night. In the
morning add the rest of the flour. The dough should
be quite soft. Work in the eggs, butter and sugar.
Knead well, and set to rise where it will not “take
cold.” When light, mould into rolls. Set close together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
in a baking-pan, and bake about twenty minutes.
Glaze while hot with white of egg, in which has
been stirred—not beaten, a little powdered sugar.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Susie’s Rusk.</span> (No. 2.) <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 quart milk.</p>

<p>½ cup yeast.</p>

<p>Flour for thick batter.</p>

<p>Set a sponge with these ingredients. When it is very
light, add,—</p>

<p>1 cup butter rubbed to a cream, with</p>

<p>2 cups powdered sugar.</p>

<p>3 eggs—well beaten.</p>

<p>Flour to make soft dough. Knead briskly, and set
to rise for four hours. Then make into rolls, and let
these stand an hour longer, or until light and “puffy,”
before baking. Glaze, just before drawing them from
the oven, with a little cream and sugar.</p>

<p>Rusk are best fresh.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Soda Biscuit without Milk.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 quart of flour.</p>

<p>2 heaping table-spoonfuls butter, chopped up in the flour.</p>

<p>2 cups cold water.</p>

<p>2 teaspoonfuls cream tartar, sifted thoroughly with the flour.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful soda, dissolved in boiling water.</p>

<p>A little salt.</p>

<p>When flour, cream of tartar, salt and butter are well
incorporated, stir the soda into the cold water, and mix
the dough very quickly, handling as little as may be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
It should be just stiff enough to roll out. Stiff soda
biscuits are always failures. Roll half an inch thick
with a few rapid strokes, cut out, and bake at once in
a quick oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Toast.</span> (<i>Very nice.</i>) <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Slices of stale baker’s bread, from which the crust has been pared.</p>

<p>1 quart of milk.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls of butter.</p>

<p>Whites of 3 eggs, beaten stiff.</p>

<p>Salt, and 2 table-spoonfuls best flour or corn-starch.</p>

<p>Boiling water.</p>

<p>Toast the bread to a golden brown. Burnt toast is
<i>detestable</i>. Have on the range, or hearth, a shallow
bowl or pudding-dish, more than half full of boiling
water, in which a table-spoonful of butter has been
melted. As each slice is toasted dip in this for a
second, sprinkle lightly with salt, and lay in the deep
heated dish in which it is to be served. Have ready, by
the time all the bread is toasted, the milk scalding hot—but
not boiled. Thicken this with the flour; let it
simmer until cooked; put in the remaining butter, and
when this is melted, the beaten whites of the eggs.
Boil up once, and pour over the toast, lifting the lower
slices one by one, that the creamy mixture may run in
between them. Cover closely, and set in the oven two
or three minutes before sending to table.</p>

<p>If you can get real cream, add only a teaspoonful of
flour and the whites of two eggs, but the same quantity
of butter used in this receipt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>


<h3>GRIDDLE CAKES.</h3>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sour Milk Cakes.</span> (<i>Good.</i>) <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 quart sour, or “loppered” milk.</p>

<p>About 4 cups sifted flour.</p>

<p>2 teaspoonfuls soda, dissolved in boiling water.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls molasses.</p>

<p>Salt to taste.</p>

<p>Mix the molasses with the milk. Put the flour into
a deep bowl, mix the salt through it; make a hole in
the middle, and pour in the milk, gradually stirring the
flour down into it with a wooden spoon. The batter
should not be too thick. When all the milk is in, beat
until the mixture is free from lumps and very smooth.
Add the soda-water, stir up fast and well, and bake
immediately.</p>

<p>These cakes are simple, economical, wholesome, and
extremely nice. “Loppered” milk, or “clabber,” is
better than buttermilk. Try them!</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Buttermilk Cakes.</span></h3>

<p>3 cups buttermilk.</p>

<p>3 cups flour, or enough for good batter.</p>

<p>1 great spoonful melted butter.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful brown sugar.</p>

<p>1 full teaspoonful soda, dissolved in hot water.</p>

<p>Salt to taste.</p>

<p>Mix as directed in last receipt, and bake at once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Grandma’s Cakes.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 quart loppered milk—if half cream, all the better.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful molasses—<i>not</i> syrup.</p>

<p>2 eggs, beaten light.</p>

<p>1 <i>good</i> teaspoonful soda, dissolved in hot water.</p>

<p>Salt to taste.</p>

<p>Flour for good batter. Begin with three even cups.</p>

<p>Stir the molasses into the milk, then the eggs and salt.
Make a hole in the flour, and mix as you would “sour
milk cakes” (the last receipt but one). Beat in the soda
at the last.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice or Hominy Cakes.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 quart milk.</p>

<p>2 cups soft-boiled rice or hominy.</p>

<p>3 eggs, beaten light.</p>

<p>1 great spoonful melted butter or lard.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful white sugar.</p>

<p>About one large cup of <i>prepared</i> flour—just enough to hold the mixture together.</p>

<p>A little salt.</p>

<p>Work the butter into the rice, then the sugar and
salt;—the eggs, beating up very hard; lastly the milk
and flour, alternately, until the batter is free from lumps
of dry flour.</p>

<p>These are wholesome and delicious, and not less so
if the batter be made a little thicker, and baked in
muffin-rings.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn-meal Flapjacks.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>1 quart boiling milk.</p>

<p>2 cups Indian meal—white. That known as “corn-flour” is best.</p>

<p>1 scant cup flour.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful butter.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful brown sugar, or molasses.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful soda, dissolved in a little hot milk.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful salt.</p>

<p>2 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately.</p>

<p>Scald the meal over night with the hot milk. Put
with this the butter and sugar. Cover and let it stand
until morning. Add the yolks of the eggs, the salt and
flour. If the batter has thickened up too much, thin
with cold milk, before stirring in the soda. The whites
should go in last, and be whipped in lightly.</p>

<p>These are the “cakes trimmed with lace” of which
we read in Mrs. Whitney’s always charming—“We
Girls.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice Cakes.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 cup raw rice.</p>

<p>1 quart milk.</p>

<p>3 eggs—very light.</p>

<p>¼ cup rice-flour.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful sugar, and same of butter.</p>

<p>¼ teaspoonful soda, dissolved in hot water.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful cream of tartar.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful salt.</p>

<p>Soak the rice five or six hours (all night is not too
long) in warm water enough to cover it. Then boil
slowly in the same until it is very soft. While still
warm—not hot, stir in the butter and sugar, the salt
and milk. When cold, put in the eggs. Sift the
cream of tartar into the rice-flour, and when you have
beaten the soda into the batter, add these.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>These cakes should be so tender as almost to melt in
the mouth.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Susie’s Flannel Cakes.</span> (<i>Without eggs.</i>) <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 cups white Indian meal.</p>

<p>2 quarts milk.</p>

<p>½ cup yeast.</p>

<p>Flour for good batter.</p>

<p>Boiling water.</p>

<p>A little salt.</p>

<p>Scald the meal with a pint or so of boiling water.
While still warm stir in the milk, and strain through
a cullender; then, add the flour, lastly the yeast.
Cover and let the batter stand until morning. Salt,
and if at all sour stir in a little soda.</p>

<p>These cakes will make a pleasant variety with
“buckwheats,” in the long winter season. They will
be found very good—so good that one will hardly believe
that they contain neither “shortening” nor eggs.</p>

<p>“You can put in an egg or two, if you wish,” says
“Susie,” modestly, “but to my notion they are quite
as nice without.”</p>

<p>And we, who have tested the “flannel” of her making,
are content to “let well enough alone.”</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls farina.</p>

<p>1 quart milk.</p>

<p>2 eggs, well beaten.</p>

<p>Enough prepared flour for good batter.</p>

<p>Boiling water.</p>

<p>Salt to taste.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful melted butter.</p>

<p>Scald the farina over night with a pint or more of
boiling water, and let it stand until morning. Thin
with the milk, beating it in gradually to avoid lumping.
Next, the beaten eggs, the salt and butter. At
last the flour stirred in with light, swift strokes. Do
not get the batter too thick.</p>

<p>Bake at once.</p>

<p>If you have not prepared flour at hand, use family
flour, with a teaspoonful of soda and two of cream
tartar.</p>

<p>1 cup cold water.</p>

<p>1 cup white flour.</p>

<p>1 cup Graham flour.</p>

<p>1 great spoonful molasses.</p>

<p>1 great spoonful butter or lard.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful soda, dissolved in hot water.</p>

<p>Salt to taste.</p>

<p>Scald and strain the meal over night; thin with the
milk, and make into a sponge with the Graham flour,
molasses and yeast. In the morning, add salt, white
flour, soda and butter, and stir in enough cold water to
make batter of the right consistency.</p>

<p>Graham and Indian cakes are far more wholesome
in the spring of the year than any preparation of
buckwheat.</p>

<h2>WHAT I KNOW ABOUT EGG-BEATERS.<br />
————————</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> no department of nice cookery are the effects of
lax or hasty manipulation more sadly and frequently
apparent than in such dishes as are dependent for excellence
upon the lightness and smoothness of beaten
eggs. Unless yolks are whipped to a thick cream, and
whites to a froth that will stand alone, the texture of
cake will be coarse, and if the loaf be not heavy or
streaked, there will be a crude flavor about it that will
betray the fault at once to the initiated. The same is
emphatically true with regard to muffins, waffles, and
griddle-cakes. Mr. Greeley said, and aptly, of two
publishers of note: “One will make a louder rattle
with a hundred dollars than the other can with a
thousand.” I have often recalled the remark in contrasting
the tender, puffy products of one housewife’s
skill with the dense, clammy cakes and crumpets of
another, who used double the quantity of eggs and
butter, and cream instead of milk.</p>

<p>“I think,” observed a friend, at whose house I was
visiting, “there must be a mistake about the muffin
receipt you gave me the other day. It calls for three
eggs. My cook insists that five are none too many,
yet hers, when made, do not look or taste like those I
ate at your table.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>In reply I craved permission to see the batter
mixed by the critical cook. Entering the kitchen in
company with the mistress, we found Chloe in the act
of breaking the five eggs directly into the flour, milk,
etc., already mixed in a large bowl. Half a dozen
strokes of the wooden spoon she held would have completed
the manufacture of the raw material. Eggs
are inveterate tell-tales, and they had given no uncertain
warning in this case, had the mistress been on the
alert.</p>

<p>Some eggs cannot be frothed. The colored “mammys”
used to tell me that they were “bewitched,”
when, with every sweep of the wisp they were depressed
and dwindled before my wondering eyes. I
have learned since that, whether this non-inflative state
be the result of undue warmth of the dish into which
the eggs are broken, or staleness of the ovates themselves,
it is a hopeless task to attempt rehabilitation.
Their demoralization is complete and fatal. The wise
housewife will give up her cake or dessert for that
day, unless she is willing to throw the obdurate eggs
away, cleanse the bowl, wiping it perfectly dry, and
let it cool before attacking another batch.</p>

<p>Nor will whites froth to stiffness if a single drop of
the yolk has found its way into them. Regardless, as
a leader of the cod-fish aristocracy, of the claims of
early associations upon memory and respect, they sullenly
assert the impossibility of rising in the world if
they are to be clogged by that which lay so close to them
before the shells were broken. All the beating of the
patent egg-whip in impatient fingers will not suffice to
make them see reason. The fact that there is ten-fold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
more nourishment and sweetness in one yolk than in a
pint of their snowy nothingness; that it is, in truth,
the life, without which an egg would be a nullity, has no
more effect in changing their exclusive notions than
have volumes of argument proving the solidity and vitality
of the middle classes upon the gaseous brains of
the <i>bon ton</i>. Humor their folly—for whites are useful,
because ornamental, if rightly handled—by carefully
taking out the offensive plebeian speck.</p>

<p>Our mothers whipped up yolks with a spoon, and
the whites with a broad-bladed knife, or clean
switches, peeled and dried. Miss Leslie’s “Complete
Cookery” will tell you all about it. (And, by the
way, if you doubt that fashions change in cookery as
in all else, I commend to your perusal this ancient
manual.) Then came a rush of patent egg-beaters, and
a rush of purchasers as well, whose aching wrists and
shoulders pleaded for relief from long hours of incessant
“beating,” “whipping,” and “frothing.” There
were wire spoons with wooden handles that broke off,
and tin handles that turned the perspiring hand black;
wire whirligigs that ran up and down upon a central
shaft and spattered the eggs over the face and bust of
the operator; cylindrical tin vessels with whirligigs
fastened in the centre, almost as good fun for the children
as a monkey on a stick, but which bound the
housewife to place and circumstance, since her eggs,
many or few, yolks and whites, must all be churned in
that vessel—not an easy one to keep clean, on account
of the fixture within it. There was altogether too much
machinery for the end to be accomplished, and the
white of a single egg was so hard to find in the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of a quart pail! After a few trials, the cook tossed
the “bothering thing” into a dark corner of the closet,
and improvised a better beater out of two silver forks,
held dexterously together. Then, our enterprising
“general furnishing” merchant overwhelmed us with
a double compound back (and forward) action machine
that was “warranted to whip up a stiff <i>méringue</i>
in a minute and a half.”</p>

<p>“I will not quite endorse that, ladies,” said the most
important tradesman in a community of housekeepers
and housekept. “But I will stake my reputation upon
its doing this in two minutes.”</p>

<p>We all bought the prize. It looked cumbrous, and
it <i>was</i> expensive, but time is money, and we remembered
that a large snow-custard must be beaten ninety
minutes with an ordinary egg-whip, and cake-frosting,
thirty. We paid, each of us, our dollar and a half, and
carried home the time-and-muscle-saver in a box of its
own, so big that we chose back streets in preference to
fashionable promenades, on our return. Trembling
with exultation, we rushed into the kitchen to display
the treasure.</p>

<p>“Yes, mem! What might it be, mem?”</p>

<p>“Why, Katey! an egg-beater! and the greatest convenience
ever manufactured!”</p>

<p>“Ah! and what a silly was meself, mem, to be
thinking it was a coffee-mill, when I saw you
a-screwin’ it on to the table!”</p>

<p>We screwed it “on to the table,” at a corner, for there
was not room for it to revolve at sides and ends. Katey
held a bowl with eggs in it at just the right elevation
below; and by turning a crank we moved a many-cogged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
wheel which fitted into another wheel, which
turned a whirligig at the bottom. Katey held the
bowl steadily; we worked very fast at the windlass-handle,
and in eight minutes the <i>méringue</i> was ready.</p>

<p>“Well done!” cried housewives, one and all. “Great
is the Grand duplex back (and forward) action Invention,
for the amelioration of weary-wristed womankind!
To be sure, it takes two people to work it, unless
one can hold the bowl firmly between the knees in
just the right place, but it is undeniably a wonderful
improvement.”</p>

<p>I, with the rest, cried, “wonderful!” even when the
bowl tipped over on the kitchen-floor, with the yolks of
ten eggs in it; when I broke the screw by giving it one
turn too many, and was blandly assured by the artificer
in metals, to whom I took it for repairs, that “them
cast-iron articles can’t never be mended, ma’am, without
it is by buying of a new one;” even when the
cogs of the wheels became rheumatic, and hitched
groaningly at every round. But when one day, in full
flight through a seething heap of icing, the steel strips
of the triple whirligig that did the whipping, suddenly
caught, the one upon the other, and came to a dead lock;
when, as I would have released them by an energetic
revolution of the wheel, they tore one another out by
the roots,—I arose in deadly calm; undid the screw, set
the bowl on the table, straightened my cramped spine,
and sent to the nearest tin-shop for a shilling whisk.</p>

<p>Four years ago, without prevision that one of the
blessings of my life was coming upon me, I paid a visit
to <i>my</i> “house-furnisher.” He had a new egg-beater
for sale.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>Vanitas vanitatum!</i>” said I, theatrically waving
it from me, “I am cured!”</p>

<p>“It comes well recommended,” remarked he, quietly.</p>

<p>“But, as you say, so many of these things are humbugs!
Will you oblige me by accepting this, giving it
a fair trial, and letting me know just what it is? I will
send it up with the rest of your articles.”</p>

<p>For three weeks—I blush to write it—THE
DOVER hung untouched in my kitchen-closet, and I
did daily penance for my sin of omission with the
shilling whisk. At last I broke the latter, and with a
slighting observation to the effect that “it might be
better than none,” I took down my gift.</p>

<p>I beg you to believe that I am not in league with the
patentee of my favorite. I do not know whether
“Dover” stands for his name, that of the manufacturing
company, or the place in which it was made. “Dover
Egg-beater, Patented 1870,” is stamped upon the circumference
of the iron wheel. I know nothing more
of its antecedents. But if I could not get another I
would not sell mine for fifty dollars—nor a hundred.
Egg-whipping ceased to be a bugbear to me from the
day of which I speak. Light, portable, rapid, easy, and
comparatively noiseless, my pet implement works like
a benevolent brownie. With it I turn out a <i>méringue</i>
in five minutes without staying my song or talk; make
the formidable “snow-custard” in less than half an
hour, with no after tremulousness of nerve or tendon.
In its operation it is impartial, yolks thickening
smoothly under it as easily as whites heighten into a
compact snow-drift, that can be cut into blocks with a
knife. Winter and summer, it has served me with invariable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
fidelity, and it is to all appearance, stanch as
when it first passed into my reluctant hands. I hope
the gentlemanly and benevolent donor will sell one
thousand per annum for the remainder of his natural
existence, and if length of days be a boon to be coveted,
that the unknown patentee will live as many years as
he has saved hours of labor to American housewives
and cooks.</p>

<h2>WHIPPED CREAM.<br />
————————</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> enters so largely into the composition of many
of our most elegant desserts, that the mode of preparing
it deserves more than a passing mention. The impression
in which I confess that I shared, for a long
time, that a “whip” was a tedious, and sometimes well-nigh
impossible performance, will soon be done away
with if one becomes the possessor of a really good syllabub
charm. That which I have used with great satisfaction
for a couple of years is a very simple affair—a
tin cylinder with a perforated bottom, and within it
a dasher, similar to that of an ordinary churn, that
plays through a hole in the top. It is best to churn
the cream in a jar or pail, there being in these less
waste from splashing. The churn is held about a
quarter of an inch from the bottom, that the cream
may pass freely below it. As the stiffened froth rises
to the top of the cream, it should be removed to a wire
sieve set over a dish. If you have no sieve, lay a piece
of coarse lace or tarletane within a cullender, and put
the “whip,” a few spoonfuls at a time, upon it. The
cream that drips into the dish below should be returned
to the pail and churned over. I regret that the
name of the patentee appears nowhere upon the modest
but excellent little machine that has supplied me with
so many trifles and Charlotte Russes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>The grand desideratum in making a “whip,” is to
have <i>real</i> cream. It should also be perfectly sweet.
The confectioner from whom I always procure mine
advised me once to put the merest pinch of soda in the
cream in warm weather, before beating it, a hint that
has proved very useful to me. With this precaution,
unless the cream be really on the verge of souring,
you will never churn your “whip” to butter, of which
lame and lamentable conclusion I had experience several
times before I received the friendly suggestion.</p>

<p>Get good cream, then. It is better worth your
while to pay half a dollar a quart for it than half the
sum for the thinner, poorer liquid sold under the same
name at the milk-stores. In the country, of course, the
true article should be abundant, and in town, you can
generally purchase small quantities at the confectioners.
A pint well worked will yield enough “whip”
for the dessert of a small family. It should be kept in
a cold place until needed, and not kept long anywhere.</p>

<p>Whipped cream is a delightful addition to coffee.
John will relish his after-dinner cup much better if
you will mantle it with this snowy richness. Remember
this when preparing your syllabub or trifle, and set
aside a few spoonfuls before seasoning it.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid of undertaking “fancy dishes.”
Sally forth bravely into the region of delicate and difficult
dainties, when you are considering family bills of
fare, and you will not be dismayed when called to get
up a handsome “company” entertainment. “Grandmother’s
way” may suit Mesdames Dull and Bigott, but
you, being accustomed to use your reasoning powers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
should remember that our estimable maternal progenitors
knew as little of locomotives and magnetic telegraphs
as of canned fruits and gelatine.</p>

<p>And, <i>entre nous</i>, I for one, and my John for two, are
getting so tired of the inevitable pie! He read aloud
to me the other day, with great gusto, a clever editorial
from the <i>Tribune</i>, showing with much ingenuity and
force, that the weakness for pie was a national vice.
I wish I had room here to reprint it. Whenever I
have been compelled since to eat a triangle of “family
pie-crust,” my usually excellent digestion has played
me false.</p>

<p>“Pie and soda-water! That is a woman’s idea of a
comfortable luncheon on a hot day in the city,” said a
gentleman to me. “At a bit of rare, tender steak, and
a mealy potato they would turn up their fastidious
noses. Such gross food is only fit for a <i>man</i>.”</p>

<p>The school-girl, rising from a barely-tasted breakfast
during which she has been saying over to herself the
chronological table, or French verb, learned the night
before,—“doesn’t care to take any luncheon with her
to-day. Certainly, no bread-and-butter—and sandwiches
are <i>hateful!</i> If you insist, mamma, just give me a piece
of pie—mince-pie, if you have it, with a slice of fruitcake
and a little cheese. I may feel hungry enough at
noon to nibble at them.”</p>

<p>Papa, running in at eleven o’clock, to announce that
he has had a business telegram which obliges him to
take the next train to Boston or Chicago, “has not time
to think of food, unless you can give me a bit of pie to
eat while you are packing my valise.” He jumps from
the cars at five <small>P.M.</small> to snatch another “bit of pie” from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
a station-restaurant, and swallows still a third, at midnight,
bought from an itinerant vender of such comestibles,
who swings himself on board when the “through
Express” halts for wood and water. If his sick headache
is not overpowering, he is adequate to the consumption
of still a fourth leathery triangle when another
stop is made at six <small>A.M.</small></p>

<p>Pie is the <i>pièce de résistance</i> in rural desserts, at
luncheon and at tea, and the mighty army mustered to
meet the attacks of pic-nics and water-parties in the
course of the year is enough to drive a dyspeptic to
suicide, when he reads the sum total of the rough computation.</p>

<p>“I always calculate to bake a dozen of a Saturday,”
says the farmer’s helpmate, resigned to cheerfulness in
the narrative. “In haying and harvesting I make as
many as thirty and forty every week. Nothing pleases
our folks so much when they come in hot and tired, as
a bit of pie—it don’t make much difference what kind—apple,
berry, squash, or damson—so long as it is
<i>pie!</i>”</p>

<p>This is not exaggeration, and the same mania for the
destructive sweet is as prevalent among the working-classes
of the city. It is useless to preach to artisans
and laborers of the indigestible qualities of such pastry
as is made by their wives at home, and bought at cheap
bakeries; to represent that baked apples, and in the season,
ripe, fresh fruits of all kinds are more nutritious,
and even cheaper, when the prices of flour, sugar, and
“shortening” are reckoned up, to say nothing of the
time spent in rolling out, basting and baking the
tough skinned, and often sour-hearted favorites.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>Jellies are scorned as “having no substance into
them;” blanc-mange is emphatically “flummery,” and
whipped cream I have heard described scornfully as
“sweetened nothing.”</p>

<p>Do not understand my strictures upon pie-olatry to
mean indiscriminate condemnation of pastry. A really
fine mince-pie is a toothsome delicacy, and the like
quality of pumpkin-pie a luscious treat. Christmas
would hardly be Christmas without the one, and I
would have the other grace every Thanksgiving feast
until the end of time. But surely there is an “out of
season,” as well as “in.”</p>

<p>“Your Toxes and your Chickses may draw out my
two front double teeth, Mrs. Richards,” said Susan
Nipper, “but that’s no reason why I need offer ’em the
whole set!”</p>

<p>And when I recall the square inches of hard and
slack-baked dyspepsia I have masticated—and swallowed—at
the bidding of civility, and a natural soft-heartedness
that would not let me grieve or shame hospitable
entertainers, I can say it almost as snappishly as
she.</p>

<p>Give John, then, and above all, the children, a respite
from the traditional, conventional and national
pie, and an opportunity to compare its solid merits with
the graces of more fanciful desserts. I can safely
promise that the health of the family will not suffer
from the change.</p>

<h2>FANCY DISHES FOR DESSERT.<br />
————————</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jelly Oranges.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>12 fine deep-colored oranges.</p>

<p>1 package Coxe’s gelatine, dissolved in one cup cold water.</p>

<p>3 cups white sugar.</p>

<p>Juice of the oranges, and grated rind of three.</p>

<p>2 cups boiling water.</p>

<p>¼ teaspoonful cinnamon.</p>

<p>Soak the gelatine three hours in the cup of cold
water. Cut from the top of each orange a round
piece, leaving a hole just large enough to admit the
bowl of a small spoon, or the handle of a larger. The
smaller the orifice, the better your dish will look.
Clean out every bit of the pulp very carefully, so as
not to tear the edges of the hole. Scrape the inner
skin from the sides with your fore-finger, and when the
oranges are emptied lay them in cold water, while you
make the jelly. Strain the juice and grated peel
through coarse, thin muslin over the sugar, squeezing
rather hard to get the coloring matter. Stir this until
it is a thick syrup, and add the spice. Pour the boiling
water upon the soaked gelatine; stir over the fire until
well dissolved; add the juice and sugar, stir all together,
and strain through a flannel bag into a pitcher,
not shaking or squeezing it, lest it should be cloudy.
Wipe off the outside of the oranges, set them close together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
in a dish, the open ends uppermost, and fill <i>very</i>
full with the warm jelly, as it will shrink in cooling.
Set away in a cold place where there is no dust. Next
day, cut each in half with a sharp penknife, taking
care to sever the skin all around before cutting into
the jelly. If neatly divided, the rich amber jelly will
be a fair counterfeit of the orange pulp. Pile in a
glass dish, with green leaves around, as you would the
real fruit.</p>

<p>This is a beautiful and delicious dish, and easily
made.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Glacé Oranges.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare precisely as in the preceding receipt, and
after cutting the oranges in two, set them where they
will freeze. In winter, a few hours out-of-doors will
accomplish this. In summer pile them carefully within
a freezer, and surround with ice and <i>rock salt</i> for
six hours; draining off the water, and replenishing with
ice and salt twice during the time.</p>

<p>These are very refreshing in hot weather.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ribbon Jelly and Cream.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>1 package Coxe’s gelatine, soaked in 2 cups of cold water.</p>

<p>2 cups white sugar.</p>

<p>1 pint <i>boiling</i> water.</p>

<p>Juice and half the grated rind of 1 lemon.</p>

<p>1 cup pale wine.</p>

<p>¼ teaspoonful cinnamon.</p>

<p>Enough prepared cochineal or bright cranberry, or other fruit syrup to color half the jelly.</p>

<p>1 pint rich sweet cream whipped stiff with two table-spoonfuls powdered sugar, and a little vanilla.</p>

<p>Soak the jelly four hours. Add to it the sugar and
seasoning, including the lemon; pour in the boiling
water, and stir until entirely dissolved. Strain through
a flannel bag, after adding the wine. Do not touch it
while it is dripping. Divide the jelly, and color half
of it pink, as above directed. Wet a mould, with a
cylinder through the centre, in cold water, and put in
the jelly, yellow and pink, in alternate layers, letting
each get pretty firm before putting in the next, until
all is used up. When you are ready to use it, wrap a
hot wet cloth about the mould for a moment, and invert
upon a dish. Have the cream whipped before
you do this, and fill the open place in the middle with
it, heaping it up well.</p>

<p>You can vary the coloring by making white and
yellow blanc-mange out of one-quarter of the gelatine
after it is soaked. Instead of water, pour a large cup
of boiling milk over this. When dissolved, sweeten and
beat into half of it the yolk of an egg. Heat over the
fire in a vessel of boiling water for five minutes to cook
the egg, stirring all the time. A stripe of the white or
yellow blanc-mange sets off the wider “ribbons” of
pink and amber very tastefully. Or you may make
the base of chocolate blanc-mange, by stirring a great
spoonful of grated sweet chocolate into the gelatine and
boiling milk.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Easter Eggs.</span> (<i>Very pretty.</i>) <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>1 package Coxe’s gelatine, soaked four hours in one pint cold water.</p>

<p>2 heaping cups sugar.</p>

<p>3 large cups boiling milk.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls grated chocolate—sweet, vanilla-flavored, if you can get it.</p>

<p>2 eggs, the yolks only.</p>

<p>A little prepared cochineal, or bright-red syrup.</p>

<p>Empty shells of 12 eggs, from which the contents have been drained through a hole in the small end.</p>

<p>Essence bitter-almond, grated lemon-peel, and rose-water for flavoring.</p>

<p>Put sugar and soaked gelatine into a bowl, and pour
the boiling milk over them. Set over the fire in a
farina-kettle, and stir until dissolved. Strain and divide
into four parts. Leave one white; stir into another
the beaten yolks; into a third the chocolate; into
the fourth the pink or scarlet coloring. Season the
chocolate with vanilla; the yellow with lemon; the
white with rose-water, the red with bitter-almond.
Heat the yellow over the fire long enough to cook the
egg. Rinse out your egg-shells with cold water, and
fill with the various mixtures, three shells of each.
Set upright in a pan of meal or flour to keep them
steady, and leave until next day. Then fill a glass
bowl more than three-quarters full, with nice wine-jelly,
broken into sparkling fragments. Break away
the egg-shells, bit by bit, from the blanc-mange. If the
insides of the shells have been properly rinsed and left
wet, there will be no trouble about this. Pile the vari-colored
“eggs” upon the bed of jelly, lay shred preserved
orange-peel, or very finely shred candied citron
about them, and surprise the children with them as an
Easter-day dessert.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>It is well to make this the day on which you bake
cake, as the contents of the egg-shells will not then be
wasted. By emptying them carefully, you can keep
the whites and yolks separate.</p>

<p>This dish, which I invented to please my own little
ones on the blessed Easter-day, is always welcomed by
them with such delight, that I cannot refrain from
recommending its manufacture to other mothers. It
is by no means difficult or expensive. If you can get
green spinach, you can have yet another color by using
the juice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Turret Cream.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 pint sweet, rich cream.</p>

<p>1 quart milk.</p>

<p>1 package Coxe’s gelatine.</p>

<p>1 heaping cup white sugar.</p>

<p>3 eggs, beaten light—whites and yolks separately.</p>

<p>½ pound crystallized fruit—cherries and peaches, or apricots.</p>

<p>Vanilla flavoring.</p>

<p>Juice of one lemon.</p>

<p>Soak the gelatine in a cup of the milk four hours.
Scald the remainder of the milk, add the sugar; when
this is dissolved, the soaked gelatine. Stir over the fire
until almost boiling hot; strain and divide into two
equal portions. Return one to the fire, and heat quickly.
When it nears the boiling-point, stir in the beaten
yolks. Let all cook together two minutes, and turn out
into a bowl to cool. While it cools, churn the cream
very stiff, and beat the whites of the eggs until they
will stand alone. Divide the latter into two heaps.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
As the yellow gelatine begins to “form,” whip one-half
of the whites into it, a little at a time. To the
white gelatine add the rest of the whites in the same
manner, alternately with the whipped cream. Season
the yellow with vanilla, the white with the lemon-juice
beaten in at the last. Wet the inside of a tall, fluted
mould with water, and arrange in the bottom, close to
the outside of the mould, a row of crystallized cherries.
Then put in a layer of the white mixture; on this the
apricots or peaches cut into strips; a layer of the yellow,
another border of cherries, and so on, until your
materials are used up. When firm, which will be in a
few hours, even in summer, if set on the ice, wrap a
cloth wrung out in hot water about the mould, and invert
upon a flat dish.</p>

<p>Eat with sweet cream, or, if you like, with brandied
fruit.</p>

<p>This is a beautiful dessert, and a handsome centre-piece
for a supper-table. It is also a safe one, even in
the hands of a novice, if these directions be followed
exactly. Bitter-almond may be substituted for the
lemon.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Naples Sponge.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>6 eggs. Use the yolks for custard.</p>

<p>1 quart of milk.</p>

<p>2 <i>large</i> cups sugar, and same quantity boiling water.</p>

<p>1 package gelatine soaked in 2 cups cold water.</p>

<p>Juice of a lemon and half the grated rind.</p>

<p>1 stale sponge-cake cut into smooth slices of uniform size.</p>

<p>2 glasses sherry.</p>

<p>Dissolve the soaked gelatine in the hot water. Add
a cup of sugar and the lemon, and stir until the mixture
is clear. Set aside in a shallow pan to cool.
Meanwhile, make a custard of the milk, the yolks, and
the other cup of sugar. Stir until it begins to thicken,
when turn into a pitcher or pail, and put away until
the “sponge” is ready for table. Whip the whites
very stiff, and beat into them, a few spoonfuls at a time,
the cooled gelatine. Spread the slices of cake, cut of
a shape and size that will fit your mould, upon a flat
dish, and wet them with the sherry. Rinse out a pudding
or jelly mould with cold water, put a thick layer
of the “sponge” in the bottom, pressing and smoothing
it down, then one of cake, fitted in neatly; another of
the sponge, proceeding in this order until all is used.
The upper layer—the base when the sponge is turned
out should be of cake.</p>

<p>Serve in a glass dish with some of the custard
poured about the base, and send around more in a
sauce-tureen or silver cream-pitcher.</p>

<p>Season the custard with vanilla.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">An Almond Charlotte.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>1 quart milk.</p>

<p>1 pint rich cream—whipped stiff.</p>

<p>Whites of 3 eggs.</p>

<p>1 great cup white sugar—powdered.</p>

<p>1 pound sweet almonds, blanched and cold.</p>

<p>Rose-water and essence of bitter almond for flavoring.</p>

<p>1 stale sponge-cake sliced.</p>

<p>Icing for top of cake.</p>

<p>1 package gelatine soaked in a cupful of the milk.
Heat the rest of the milk to boiling; put in the sugar
and soaked gelatine. Heat again before adding the
almond paste. This should be ready, before you begin
the Charlotte. Blanch the almonds by putting
them into <i>boiling</i> water, skinning them, and letting
them get cold and crisp. Pound in a mortar, dropping
in rose-water, now and then, to prevent oiling.
Stir this paste well into the hot milk; let it simmer
with it two or three minutes; then strain through
coarse muslin, squeezing hard to get out the strength.
Flavor and set by until cold and a little stiff around
the edges. Beat the whites of the eggs stiff and add
the gelatine gradually—beating steadily—alternately
with the whipped cream. Butter your mould, and
line with slices of sponge-cake fitted closely together.
Fill with the mixture, pressing it in firmly and evenly.
In eight or ten hours, turn it out upon a dish, and ice
as you would a cake, but on the top only. While the
frosting is soft, ornament with fancy candies, laid on
in any shape you may fancy.</p>

<h4><i>Or,</i></h4>

<p>You may simplify matters by reserving one large
piece of cake—a slice cut the full width of the loaf;
trimming it to fit the bottom of the mould, and only
lining the sides of the latter. The Charlotte will turn
out as well without the top (or bottom), and you can
have it frosted and ornamented by the time you empty
the mould. Lay it carefully on the top of the gelatine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Narcissus Blanc-Mange.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart milk.</p>

<p>Less than a pint rich cream, whipped with a <i>little</i> powdered sugar.</p>

<p>1 package Cooper’s gelatine, soaked in 2 cups of cold water.</p>

<p>Yolks of 4 eggs, beaten light.</p>

<p>2 cups white sugar.</p>

<p>Vanilla and rose-water for flavoring.</p>

<p>Heat the milk scalding hot, stir in the gelatine and
sugar. When all are dissolved, beat in the yolks, and
heat until they are cooked. Two minutes, after the
custard becomes scalding hot, should suffice. Turn
out into a broad dish to cool. When it stiffens around
the edges, transfer it, a few spoonfuls at a time, to a
bowl, and whip vigorously with your egg-beater.
Flavor with rose-water. It should be like a yellow
sponge before you put it into the mould. This should
be an open one, <i>i.e.</i>, with a cylinder in the centre. Rinse
with cold water, and fill with the blanc-mange. It is
best made the day before it is to be used. After turning
it out upon a dish, fill the hollowed centre with whipped
cream, flavored with vanilla and heaped up as high as
it will stand. Pile more whipped cream about the base.</p>

<p>This dessert is named for the pretty yellow and
white flower which came, with the earliest days of
Spring, to the old-fashioned gardens.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tipsy Trifle.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>1 quart milk.</p>

<p>5 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately.</p>

<p>1 stale sponge-cake.</p>

<p>½ pound macaroons.</p>

<p>1 cup sugar.</p>

<p>Vanilla, or bitter-almond for flavoring.</p>

<p>1 cup sherry wine, and 1 cup jelly or jam.</p>

<p>Make a custard of the milk, sugar and yolks, adding
the latter when the milk <i>almost</i> boils, and stirring constantly
until it begins to thicken. Flavor when cold.
Slice your cake, and line the bottom of a glass dish
with it. Wet with the wine, and cover with jam or
jelly. A layer of macaroons over this must also be
wet with sherry. Another layer of cake, moistened
with wine and spread with jam; more macaroons,
and so on, until the dish is three-quarters full. Pour
the cold custard over all; beat the whites of the eggs
stiff with a few spoonfuls of bright jelly, and heap
smoothly on top. Drop a bit of red jelly here and
there upon it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Strawberry Trifle.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>This is made substantially as above—but the macaroons
and wine are omitted, and the sponge-cake wet
with sweet cream. Layers of ripe strawberries (cut
in two, if the fruit is large), sprinkled with powdered
sugar, are substituted for the jam; strawberry-juice,
well sweetened, is whipped into the <i>méringue</i> on top,
and this ornamented with ripe, scarlet berries.</p>

<p>This is very nice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Créme du Thé.</span> (<i>Good.</i>)</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>1 pint rich cream, whipped light.</p>

<p>½ package gelatine, soaked in 1 cup of milk.</p>

<p>1 large cup of <i>strong</i> mixed tea—the best quality.</p>

<p>1 cup white sugar.</p>

<p>Whites of 2 eggs.</p>

<p>Dissolve the soaked gelatine and sugar in the boiling
tea, when you have strained the latter through fine
muslin, and let it cool. Whip the cream and the
whites of the eggs in separate vessels. When the gelatine
is perfectly cold, beat it by degrees into the
whites until it is a pretty firm froth. Then whip in
the cream. Rinse a mould in cold water, fill it with
the mixture, and set in a very cold place, or on ice, for
eight or ten hours. Send around a pitcher of sweet
cream with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Créme du Café.</span></h3>

<p>Is made precisely as is the <i>créme du thé</i>, but substituting
a large cup of strong black coffee for the tea.
It is even more popular than the tea-cream.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to make both at the same time, one
package of gelatine serving for all, and give your
guests their choice of tea or coffee. If set to form in
custard-cups and turned out upon a flat dish in alternate
rows, they make a handsome show. The darker
color of the coffee will distinguish it from the tea.</p>

<p>A small pitcher of sweet cream should accompany
them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Créme du Chocolat.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>1 quart of milk.</p>

<p>1 pint of cream, whipped light.</p>

<p>½ package of gelatine, soaked in 1 cup of the milk.</p>

<p>2 eggs, yolks and whites beaten separately.</p>

<p>1 cup of sugar—powdered.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls grated chocolate.</p>

<p>Vanilla to taste.</p>

<p>Scald the milk, and stir into it while still in the
saucepan, the soaked gelatine and sugar. Heat up
once, and when the gelatine is quite dissolved, strain.
The chocolate should be wet up with cold water before
it is put into the hot milk. Stir up thoroughly,
return to the saucepan, and when smoking hot, add it
gradually to the beaten yolks. Set back on the fire
and boil very gently five minutes—not more, or the
eggs may curdle. Turn into a broad pan to cool.
Whip, when it begins to coagulate, gradually and
thoroughly with the beaten whites, flavoring with vanilla.
Lastly, beat in the whipped cream.</p>

<p>You can add this to your coffee and tea creams, and
complete the assortment. Mould as you do them, but
serve with brandied fruit, instead of cream. Most
people are very fond of it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Blanc-Mange.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk.</p>

<p>½ package gelatine, dissolved in 1 cup cold water.</p>

<p>1 cup sugar.</p>

<p>3 great spoonfuls grated chocolate.</p>

<p>Vanilla to taste.</p>

<p>Heat the milk; stir in sugar and soaked gelatine.
Strain; add chocolate; boil ten minutes, stirring all
the time. When nearly cold, beat for five minutes—hard
with your “Dover” egg-beater, or until it begins
to stiffen. Flavor; whip up once, and put into a wet
mould. It will be firm in six or eight hours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Blanc-Mange and Cream.</span></h3>

<p>Make the blanc-mange as directed in last receipt.
Set it to form in a mould with a cylinder in centre.
You can improvise one by stitching together a roll of
stiff paper just the height of the pail or bowl in which
you propose to mould your blanc-mange, and holding
it firmly in the middle of this while you pour the mixture
around it. The paper should be well buttered.
Lay a book or other light weight on the cylinder to
keep it erect. When the blanc-mange is turned out,
slip out the paper, and fill the cavity with whipped
cream, heaping some about the base. Specks of
bright jelly enliven this dish if disposed tastefully
upon the cream.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Custards</span> (<i>baked</i>).</h3>

<p>1 quart of good milk.</p>

<p>6 eggs—yolks and whites separated.</p>

<p>1 cup sugar.</p>

<p>4 great spoonfuls grated chocolate.</p>

<p>Vanilla flavoring.</p>

<p>Scald the milk; stir in the chocolate and simmer
two minutes, to dissolve, and incorporate it well with
the milk. Beat up the yolks with the sugar and
put into the hot mixture. Stir for one minute before
seasoning and pouring into the cups, which should be
set ready in a pan of boiling water. They should
be half submerged, that the water may not bubble
over the tops. Cook slowly about twenty minutes,
or until the custards are firm. When cold, whip the
whites of the eggs to a <i>méringue</i> with a very little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
powdered sugar—(most <i>méringues</i> are too sweet) and
pile some upon the top of each cup. Put a piece of
red jelly on the <i>méringue</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Custards</span> (<i>boiled</i>).</h3>

<p>1 quart of milk.</p>

<p>6 eggs—whites and yolks separately beaten.</p>

<p>1 cup of sugar.</p>

<p>4 large spoonfuls grated chocolate.</p>

<p>Vanilla to taste—a teaspoonful to the pint is a good rule.</p>

<p>Scald the milk; stir in sugar and chocolate. Boil
gently five minutes, and add the yolks. Cook five minutes
more, or until it begins to thicken up well, stirring
all the time. When nearly cold beat in the flavoring,
and whisk all briskly for a minute before pouring
into the custard cups. Whip up the whites with a
little powdered sugar, or what is better, half a cup of
currant or cranberry jelly, and heap upon the custards.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rockwork.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk.</p>

<p>6 eggs.</p>

<p>1 cup powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Vanilla flavoring.</p>

<p>Sweeten the milk slightly and set it over the fire in
a rather wide-mouthed saucepan. Beat the whites of
the eggs to a very stiff froth with a table-spoonful or
so of the sugar. When the milk boils, put in the
froth, a table-spoonful at a time, turning each little
heap as it is cooked on the lower side. Have only a
few spoonfuls in at once, or they will run together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Take out the cooked froth care fully with a skimmer
and lay on a sieve. When all are done, set in a cool
place, while you make a custard of the yolks beaten up
with the sugar and the boiling milk. Stir until it begins
to thicken, and pour out to cool. Flavor when
cold; fill a glass bowl with the custard and pile the
“rocks” on the surface.</p>

<p>A pretty variation of floating island. Serve with
sponge-cake.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">An Ambushed Trifle.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>A round stale sponge-cake.</p>

<p>1 pint milk.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful corn-starch.</p>

<p>1 cup sweet jelly or jam. Crab-apple jelly is very nice.</p>

<p>3 eggs beaten light.</p>

<p>A pinch of salt.</p>

<p>Vanilla, lemon, or bitter almond flavoring.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Cut the top from the cake in one piece and lay it
aside. Scoop out the inside of the cake, leaving side
walls and a bottom about an inch thick. Coat these
well with the jelly. Scald the milk; beat the eggs
with the sugar, and stir into this when it is almost boiling.
Crumb the cake you have scooped out very
finely, and beat into the hot custard. Return to the
fire and cook, stirring all the while until thick and
smooth, when add the corn-starch, previously wet with
cold milk. Cook a minute longer and take from the
fire. When nearly cold, flavor and fill the cake with
it. Cover the inside of the lid you have laid aside
with jelly, fit neatly into its place; brush the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
cake with white of egg, sift powdered sugar thickly
over it, and set in a cool, dry place until wanted.</p>

<p>A simple, delightful dessert.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Orange Trifle.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 pint cream, whipped stiff.</p>

<p>3 eggs—yolks only.</p>

<p>1 cup of powdered sugar.</p>

<p>½ package Coxe’s gelatine, soaked in a cup of cold water.</p>

<p>Juice of 2 sweet oranges.</p>

<p>Grated rind of 1 orange.</p>

<p>1 cup boiling water.</p>

<p>Stir the soaked gelatine in the boiling water. Mix
the juice, rind and sugar together, and pour the hot
liquid over them. Should the gelatine not dissolve
readily, set all over the fire and stir until clear. Strain,
and stir in the beaten yolks. Heat quickly within a
vessel of boiling water, stirring constantly lest the
yolks should curdle. If they should, strain again
through coarse flannel. Set aside until perfectly cold
and slightly stiff, when whip in the frothed cream.
Wet a mould, fill, and set it on ice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Trifle.</span></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>1 dozen tender pippins of fine flavor.</p>

<p>1 large cup of sugar, for custard—one—smaller—for apples.</p>

<p>1 scant quart rich milk.</p>

<p>4 eggs.</p>

<p>Juice and half the grated peel of 1 lemon.</p>

<p>1 pint of cream, whipped up with a little powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Slice the apples; put them in an earthenware or
glass jar; cover lightly and set in a kettle of warm
water. Bring to a boil, and cook gently until the
apples are tender and clear. Beat to a pulp, sweeten
with the smaller cup of sugar; add lemon-juice and
rind, and put them into a glass dish. Make a custard
of milk, sugar and eggs; boil until it thickens up
well, and let it get perfectly cold. Cover the apple
compote with it, spoonful by spoonful. The apple
should be cold and stiff, or it may rise to the top of
the custard. Lastly, pile the whipped cream over all.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon Trifle.</span> (<i>Delicious.</i>)</h3>

<p>2 lemons—juice of both and grated rind of one.</p>

<p>1 cup sherry.</p>

<p>1 large cup of sugar.</p>

<p>1 pint cream well sweetened and whipped stiff.</p>

<p>A little nutmeg.</p>

<p>Strain the lemon-juice over the sugar and grated
peel, and let them lie together two hours before adding
the wine and nutmeg. Strain again and whip
gradually into the frothed cream. Serve in jelly-glasses
and send around cake with it. It should be
eaten soon after it is made.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Queen of Trifles.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>


<p>½ lb. “lady fingers,” or square sponge-cakes.</p>

<p>½ lb. macaroons.</p>

<p>½ lb. sweet almonds blanched.</p>

<p>½ lb. crystallized fruit, chopped fine.</p>

<p>1 cup sweet jelly or jam.</p>

<p>1 glass of brandy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>1 glass of best sherry.</p>

<p>Rose-water.</p>

<p>1 pint of cream, whipped.</p>

<p>1 pint of rich milk for custard.</p>

<p>4 eggs, whites and yolks separated.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful corn-starch.</p>

<p>1 small cup sugar for custard.</p>

<p>A little powdered sugar for whipped cream.</p>

<p>Vanilla flavoring for custard.</p>

<p>Put sponge-cakes at the bottom of a large glass
dish; wet with brandy, and cover thinly with jelly.
Strew the minced fruits thickly upon this. Next come
the macaroons. Wet with the wine and cover thickly
with jelly. Set the dish in a cool place while you prepare
the custard. This will give the cakes time to
soak up the liquor.</p>

<p>Scald the milk; beat the yolks and sugar together
and make a paste of the blanched almonds by pounding
them in a Wedgewood mortar (or, in a stout bowl
with a potato beetle), adding rose-water as you go on
to prevent oiling. Stir this paste into the hot milk,
and, a minute later, the yolks and sugar. Cook, stirring
constantly, for three minutes more, when put in
the corn-starch, wet up with cold milk. Let all
thicken well and smoothly; take from the fire, beat up
to break possible lumps, and turn out to cool.</p>

<p>Whip the cream, and sweeten to taste. Whisk the
whites of the eggs stiff and mix thoroughly with the
whipped cream. When the custard is perfectly cold,
cover the cakes in the glass dish with it, and heap the
cream on top.</p>

<p>There is no better trifle than this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Snow.</span> (<i>No. 1.</i>) <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>6 fine pippins.</p>

<p>2 cups powdered sugar.</p>

<p>1 lemon—juice and half the grated peel.</p>

<p>1 pint of milk for custard.</p>

<p>4 eggs.</p>

<p>Make a good custard of the milk, one cup of sugar
and the yolks. Bake the apples, cores, skins and all,
in a covered dish with a little water in the bottom to
prevent burning. The apples should be so tender that
a straw will pierce them. Take off the skins and
scrape out the pulp. Mix in the sugar and lemon.
Whip the whites of the eggs light, and beat in the
pulp by degrees until very white and firm. Put the
custard, when cold, into the bottom of a glass bowl
and pile the snow upon it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Snow.</span> (<i>No. 2.</i>) <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>½ lb. macaroons.</p>

<p>1 cup good custard.</p>

<p>4 fine pippins (raw).</p>

<p>Whites of 4 eggs.</p>

<p>½ cup powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Put the macaroons in the bottom of a glass dish,
and cover with the custard before you make the snow.
Whisk the eggs and sugar to a <i>méringue</i> before
paring the apples. Peel and grate each directly into
the frothed egg and sugar, and whip in quickly before
touching the next. The pulp will better preserve its
color if thus coated before the air can affect it. It is
well for one person to hold the egg-beater and work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
in the apple while an assistant grates it. Pile upon
the soaked macaroons and set on ice until wanted. It
should be eaten soon after it is made.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Orange Snow.</span></h3>

<p>4 large, sweet oranges. Juice of all and grated peel of one.</p>

<p>Juice and half the grated peel of 1 lemon.</p>

<p>1 package of gelatine, soaked in cup of cold water.</p>

<p>Whites of 4 eggs, whipped stiff.</p>

<p>1 cup—a large one—of powdered sugar.</p>

<p>1 pint boiling water.</p>

<p>Mix the juice and peel of the fruit with the soaked
gelatine; add the sugar; stir all up well and let them
alone for an hour. Then pour on the boiling water,
and stir until clear. Strain through a coarse cloth,
pressing and wringing it hard. When quite cold,
whip into the frothed whites gradually, until thick and
white. Put into a wet mould for eight hours.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon Snow.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>3 lemons—if large—4 if small. Grated peel of two.</p>

<p>4 eggs—the whites only—whipped to standing froth.</p>

<p>1 package of gelatine soaked in 1 cup cold water.</p>

<p>1 pint <i>boiling</i> water.</p>

<p>1 glass sherry or white wine—a large glass.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful nutmeg.</p>

<p>2 cups powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Add to the soaked gelatine the juice of all the
lemons, and peel of two, the sugar and spice, and let
them stand together one hour. Then pour the boiling
water over them. Stir until dissolved, and strain into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
a wide bowl. When nearly cold, add the wine.
When quite cold, begin to whip the mixture gradually
into the frothed egg, and beat until thick, white and
smooth. Wet a mould in cold water and set the snow
aside in it until firm.</p>

<p>If you like, you can pour a rich custard about the
base after dishing it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice Snow.</span></h3>

<p>5 table-spoonfuls rice flour.</p>

<p>1 quart of milk.</p>

<p>4 eggs—the whites only—whipped light.</p>

<p>1 large spoonful of butter.</p>

<p>1 cup powdered sugar.</p>

<p>A pinch of cinnamon and same of nutmeg.</p>

<p>Vanilla or other extract for flavoring.</p>

<p>A little salt.</p>

<p>Wet up the flour with cold water and add to the
milk when the latter is scalding hot. Boil until it begins
to thicken; put in the sugar and spice; simmer
five minutes, stirring constantly, and turn into a bowl
before beating in the butter. Let it get cold before
flavoring it. Whip, a spoonful at a time, into the
beaten eggs. Set to form in a wet mould.</p>

<p>Send sweet cream around with it.</p>

<p>This is delicate and wholesome fare for invalids. If
you wish to have it especially nice, add half a pint of
cream, whipped light and beaten in at the last.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Summer Snow.</span> (<i>Extremely fine.</i>)</h3>

<p>1 package Coxe’s gelatine, soaked in 1 cup cold water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>2 cups powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Juice and peel of 1 lemon.</p>

<p>Half a pine-apple, cut in small pieces.</p>

<p>2 cups boiling water.</p>

<p>1 glass best brandy.</p>

<p>2 glasses best sherry or white wine.</p>

<p>A little nutmeg.</p>

<p>4 eggs—the whites only—whipped.</p>

<p>Mix into the soaked gelatine the sugar, lemon, pine-apple,
and nutmeg. Let them stand together two
hours, when you have bruised the fruit with the back
of a silver or wooden spoon and stirred all thoroughly.
Pour over them, at the end of that time, the boiling
water, and stir until the gelatine is dissolved. Strain
through coarse flannel, squeezing and wringing hard.
When almost cold, put in the wine and brandy.
Cover until quite cold. Whip in, by degrees, into the
beaten whites. It ought to be whisked half an hour,
even if you use the “Dover.” Bury in the ice to
“form,” having wet the mould with cold water.</p>

<p>This is most refreshing and delicious.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Syllabub.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 quart rich cream.</p>

<p>4 eggs—the whites only.</p>

<p>1 glass white wine.</p>

<p>2 <i>small</i> cups powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Flavor to taste.</p>

<p>Whip half the sugar into the cream—the rest with
the eggs. Mix these and add wine and flavoring at
the last.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Velvet Cream.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 pint best cream whipped very stiff.</p>

<p>½ package Coxe’s gelatine, soaked in 1 cup cold water.</p>

<p>3 glasses white wine.</p>

<p>Juice of 1 large lemon.</p>

<p>Bitter almond flavoring.</p>

<p>1 cup powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Put sugar, lemon, soaked gelatine and wine into a
bowl, cover closely to keep in the flavor of the wine
and let them stand together one hour. Stir up well,
and set the bowl (or jar), still covered, into a saucepan
of boiling water for fifteen minutes, or until the
gelatine is dissolved and the mixture clear. Strain,
and let it cool before flavoring. Beat gradually into
the whipped cream. Wet a mould, fill and set directly
upon the ice until wanted.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroon Basket.</span></h3>

<p>1 lb. macaroons—almond or cocoanut, or “kisses.”</p>

<p>1 large cup white sugar.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful dry gum arabic.</p>

<p>½ cup of water—<i>boiling</i>.</p>

<p>Dissolve the gum arabic in the hot water thoroughly;
then stir in the sugar. Boil gently until very
thick. Set it, while using it, in a pan of boiling
water to keep hot. Take a round tin pail (a fluted
mould will not do so well), butter thickly on bottom
and sides, dip the edges only of each macaroon in the
hot candy and lay them in close rows on the bottom
until it is covered. Let them get perfectly dry, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
be sure they adhere firmly to one another before you
begin the lower row of the sides. Build up your wall,
one row at a time, letting each harden before adding
another. When the basket is done and firm, lift carefully
from the mould; make a loop-handle at each
end with four or five macaroons, stuck together; set
on a flat dish and heap with whipped cream. Sprinkle
comfits over the cream, or ornament with red jelly.</p>

<p>With a little care and practice any deft housewife
can build this basket. A mould of <i>stiff</i> white paper,
lightly stitched together and well buttered, has several
advantages above one of tin. You can make it of any
shape you like, and remove it without risk of breaking
the basket, by clipping the threads that hold it together.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jelly Custards.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart milk.</p>

<p>6 eggs—whites and yolks.</p>

<p>1 cup sugar.</p>

<p>Flavoring to taste.</p>

<p>Some red and yellow jelly—raspberry is good for one, orange jelly for the other.</p>

<p>Make a custard of the eggs, milk and sugar; boil
gently until it thickens well. Flavor when cold; fill
your custard-glasses two-thirds full and heap up with
the two kinds of jelly—the red upon some, the yellow
on others.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Jelly.</span> (<i>Nice.</i>)</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>1 dozen well-flavored pippins.</p>

<p>2 cups powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Juice of 2 lemons—grated peel of one.</p>

<p>½ package Coxe’s gelatine soaked in 1 cup of cold water.</p>

<p>Pare, core and slice the apples, throwing each piece
into cold water as it is cut, to preserve the color.
Pack them in a glass or stoneware jar with just cold
water enough to cover them; put on the top, <i>loosely</i>,
that the steam may escape; set in a pot of warm
water and bring to a boil. Cook until the apples are
broken to pieces. Have ready in a bowl, the soaked
gelatine, sugar, lemon-juice and peel. Strain the apple
pulp scalding hot, over them; stir until the gelatine
is dissolved; strain again—this time through a
flannel bag, without shaking or squeezing it; wet a
mould with cold water and set in a cold place until
firm.</p>

<p>This is very nice formed in an open mould (one
with a cylinder in the centre), and with the cavity
filled and heaped with whipped cream or syllabub.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peach Jelly.</span></h3>

<p>Is made as you would apple, and with a few peach-kernels

<p>Juice of 1 lemon.</p>

<p>⅔ package Coxe’s gelatine soaked in 1 cup cold water.</p>

<p>1 pint boiling water.</p>

<p>Mash the strawberries to a pulp and strain them
through coarse muslin. Mix the sugar and lemon-juice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
with the soaked gelatine; stir up well and pour
over them the boiling water. Stir until clear.
Strain through flannel bag; add the strawberry juice;
strain again, without shaking or pressing the bag; wet
a mould with cylinder in centre, in cold water; fill it
and set in ice to form.</p>

<p>Turn out upon a cold dish; fill with whipped
cream, made quite sweet with powdered sugar, and
served at once.</p>

<p>It is very fine.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raspberry and Currant Jelly.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart currants.</p>

<p>1 quart red or Antwerp raspberries.</p>

<p>2 cups white sugar.</p>

<p>1 package gelatine soaked in 1 cup cold water.</p>

<p>1 cup boiling water.</p>

<p>Whipped cream—made very sweet—for centre.</p>

<p>Crush the fruit in a stoneware jar with a wooden
beetle, and strain out every drop of the juice that will
come away. Stir the sugar and soaked gelatine together;
pour the boiling water over them; when
clear, strain into the fruit-juice. Strain again through
flannel bag; wet an “open” mould; fill with the
jelly, and bury in ice to form.</p>

<p>Turn out upon a very cold dish; fill the centre with
the cream.</p>

<p>1 package Coxe’s gelatine, soaked in 2 cups cold water.</p>

<p>2 glasses pale sherry or white wine.</p>

<p>1 pint boiling water.</p>

<p>Stir sugar, lemon-juice, peel, and soaked gelatine together,

<p>1 glass <i>best</i> brandy.</p>

<p>1 package gelatine, soaked in 2 cups of water.</p>

<p>1 pint boiling water.</p>

<p>2 cups sugar.</p>

<p>Make as you would lemon jelly.</p>

<p>In each of these receipts, should the fruit yield <i>less</i>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tutti Frutti Jelly.</span> (<i>Very good.</i>) <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 package Coxe’s gelatine, soaked in 2 cups water.</p>

<p>Juice and grated peel of 1 lemon.</p>

<p>1 fine orange, all the juice and half the peel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>1 glass best brandy.</p>

<p>1 glass white wine.</p>

<p>3 cups boiling water.</p>

<p>½ lb. crystallized cherries.</p>

<p>½ lb. crystallized apricots, peaches, etc., cut into shreds.</p>

<p>½ lb. sweet almonds, blanched by being thrown into boiling water, and skinned. Throw into cold water so soon as blanched, until you are ready to use them.</p>

<p>2 cups white sugar.</p>

<p>Mix soaked gelatine, sugar, lemon and orange juice,
and peel. Let them stand together one hour, then
pour on boiling water. When the gelatine is melted,
strain; add the liquor; strain again through double
flannel, not touching the bag while it drips. When the
jelly begins to congeal, pour some in the bottom of a
wet, fluted mould. A rather tall one is best. Let
this get tolerably firm, keeping the rest of the jelly,
meanwhile, in a pan of warm—not boiling water—lest
it should harden before you are ready for the next
layer. Lay a row of bright-red <i>glacé</i> cherries on the
jelly, close to the outside of the mould; within this
ring a stratum of the other fruits neatly shred. More
jelly, and, when it is firm enough to bear them, another
ring of cherries, and, within this, a layer of the almonds
cut into thin shavings. Jelly again, more fruit, and so
on until the mould is full or your materials used up. If
possible, have the outer ring of each fruit and almond
layer of cherries. Set in ice to form. If frozen, the
jelly and fruits will be all the better. I have sometimes
left mine purposely where I knew it must freeze.</p>

<p>This is a beautiful centre-piece for a dessert or
supper-table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wine Jelly.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>1 package sparkling gelatine, soaked in 1 large cup of cold water.</p>

<p>2 cups white wine or pale sherry.</p>

<p>1 lemon—all the juice and half the peel.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful bitter almond, or two peach-leaves.</p>

<p>2 cups white sugar.</p>

<p>1 pint boiling water.</p>

<p>Put soaked gelatine, lemon, sugar, and flavoring extract
together, and cover for half an hour. Then pour
on boiling water, stir and strain. After adding the
wine, strain again through flannel bag. Wet a mould
and set in a cold place until the next day.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Claret Jelly.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 package Coxe’s gelatine, soaked in <i>large</i> cup water.</p>

<p>2 cups sugar.</p>

<p>2 cups fine claret.</p>

<p>1 pint boiling water.</p>

<p>1 lemon—the juice only.</p>

<p>A pinch of mace.</p>

<p>Make as you would other wine jelly.</p>

<p>It is most refreshing in summer.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Note upon Jellies.</span></h3>

<p>It must be borne in mind that the consistency of
jelly depends much upon the weather. In warm or
damp, it is sometimes difficult to make it either clear
or firm. I have tried to guard against failure in the
use of any of the foregoing receipts by setting down
the <i>minimum quantity</i> of liquid that can be used without
making the jellies too stiff. If made in clear, cold
weather, there will be no risk in having the “large cup
of cold water,” in which the gelatine is soaked, one-third
larger than if the jelly were undertaken on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
murky spring day. A little experience will teach you
how to guard this point. Meanwhile, be assured that
you need not fear splashing, weak jellies where you
hoped for firmness and brilliancy, if you follow the directions
written down in this department.</p>

<h2>PUDDINGS OF VARIOUS KINDS.<br />
————————</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice Pudding with Fruit.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of new milk, or as fresh as you can get it.</p>

<p>1 cup raw rice.</p>

<p>4 eggs.</p>

<p>1 great spoonful of butter.</p>

<p>1 cup sugar, and same of fine bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>½ cup suet (powdered).</p>

<p>½ lb. raisins, seeded and chopped.</p>

<p>½ lb. currants, washed well and dried.</p>

<p>¼ lb. citron, minced fine.</p>

<p>Soak the rice over night, or for five hours, in a
little warm water. Boil until tender in one pint of
the milk. Simmer gently, and do not stir it. Set
the saucepan in hot water, and cook in that way to
avoid burning, shaking up the rice now and then.
When done, beat in the butter. Butter a mould well,
and cover the bottom with the bread-crumbs. Cover
this with rice; wet with a raw custard made of the
other pint of milk, the yolks of the eggs and the sugar.
On this sprinkle suet; then a layer of the mixed fruit.
More bread-crumbs, rice, custard, suet and fruit, until
the dish is nearly full. The top layer should be
crumbs. Bake for an hour in a moderate oven.
When nearly done, draw to the door of the oven and
cover with a <i>méringue</i> made of the whites of the eggs
whisked stiff with a very little powdered sugar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Eat warm, with sweetened cream as sauce. But it
is also very good cold, eaten with cream.</p>

<p>This, in my opinion, deserves the highest rank among
rice puddings, which are, by the way, far more respectable
as desserts than is usually believed. There are so
many indifferent, and worse than indifferent ones made
and eaten, that discredit has fallen upon the whole
class. If properly made and cooked, they are not only
wholesome, but palatable dainties.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Almond Rice Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk.</p>

<p>1 cup raw rice.</p>

<p>5 eggs.</p>

<p>1 cup sugar.</p>

<p>A little salt.</p>

<p>A little grated lemon-peel—about one teaspoonful.</p>

<p>½ pound sweet almonds, blanched.</p>

<p>Soak the rice in a very little water for four hours;
put it into a farina-kettle; fill the outer kettle with
hot water; pour a pint of milk over the rice, and simmer
gently until it is tender, and each grain almost
translucent. Beat the eggs and sugar together, add
the other pint of milk, then the rice. Mix all well together,
flavor with the lemon-peel (or two or three
peach-leaves may be boiled with the rice, if you do not
like the lemon). Boil in a buttered mould. An oval
fluted one is prettiest if you have it—what is known as
the musk-melon pattern. It should be cooked steadily
about an hour—certainly not less. Dip the mould in
cold water; let it stand uncovered an instant; turn
out upon a flat dish and stick it all over with the
almonds blanched, and cut into long shreds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Have ready some rich, sweet custard for sauce, or
sweetened cream.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Southern Rice Pudding.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 quart fresh, sweet milk.</p>

<p>1 cup raw rice.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls butter.</p>

<p>1 cup sugar.</p>

<p>4 eggs, beaten light.</p>

<p>Grated lemon-peel—about one teaspoonful.</p>

<p>A pinch of cinnamon, and same of mace.</p>

<p>Soak the rice in a cup of the milk for two hours.
Turn into a farina-kettle; add the rest of the milk, and
simmer until the rice is tender. Rub the butter and
sugar to a cream. Beat up the eggs, and whisk this
into them until the mixture is very light. Let the rice
cool a little while you are doing this. Stir all together,
flavor, put into a buttered mould, and bake about three-quarters
of an hour in a moderate oven. If baked too
long the custard will separate into curds and whey.</p>

<p>Eat warm with sauce, or cold with sugar and cream.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice Méringue.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Make according to the above receipt, but when done,
draw to the door of the oven, and cover with the following
mixture:</p>

<p>Whites of four eggs, whisked stiff.</p>

<p>1 large table-spoonful powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Juice of 1 lemon.</p>

<p>Spread quickly and evenly. Close the oven and
bake three minutes more, or until it is very delicately
browned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rosie’s Rice Custard.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk.</p>

<p>3 eggs, well beaten.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls sugar.</p>

<p>1 scant table-spoonful butter.</p>

<p>A little salt.</p>

<p>1 small cup <i>boiled</i> rice.</p>

<p>Boil the rice, and while still warm, drain, and stir
into the milk. Beat the eggs; rub butter and sugar
together, and add to them. Mix all up well, and bake
in buttered dish half an hour in a pretty quick oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tapioca Custard Pudding.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 cup tapioca, soaked over night in cold water enough to cover it.</p>

<p>1 quart of milk.</p>

<p>1 large cup powdered sugar.</p>

<p>5 eggs.</p>

<p>Half the grated peel of one lemon.</p>

<p>A very little salt.</p>

<p>Make a custard of the yolks, sugar and milk. Warm
the milk slightly in a farina-kettle before mixing with
the other ingredients. Beat this custard into the
soaked tapioca; salt; whisk the whites of the eggs to
a standing froth, stir in swiftly and lightly; set the
pudding-dish (well buttered) into a pan of boiling
water, and bake, covered, in a moderate oven until the
custard is well “set.” Brown delicately by setting it
for a minute on the upper grating of a quicker oven.</p>

<p>This may be eaten warm or cold, with or without
sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">English Tapioca Pudding.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 cup tapioca.</p>

<p>3 pints fresh milk.</p>

<p>5 eggs.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls butter.</p>

<p>1 cup sugar.</p>

<p>½ pound raisins, seeded and cut in half.</p>

<p>Half the grated peel of 1 lemon.</p>

<p>Soak the tapioca one hour in a pint of the milk;
pour into a glass, or stone-ware jar; set in a pot of
warm water and bring to a boil. When the tapioca is
soft all through, turn out to cool somewhat, while you
make the custard. Beat the eggs very light; rub
butter and sugar together; mix all with the tapioca,
the fruit last. Bake in buttered dish one hour.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Arrowroot Pudding.</span> (<i>Cold.</i>)</h3>

<p>3 even table-spoonfuls arrowroot.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls of sugar.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of butter.</p>

<p>3 cups rich new milk.</p>

<p>¼ pound crystallized peaches, chopped fine.</p>

<p>Heat the milk scalding hot in a farina-kettle. Wet
the arrowroot with cold milk, and stir into this. When
it begins to thicken, add sugar and butter. Stir constantly
for fifteen minutes. Turn out into a bowl, and
when almost cold beat in the fruit. Wet a mould,
put in the mixture, and set in a cold place until
firm.</p>

<p>Eat with powdered sugar and cream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Arrowroot Pudding.</span> (<i>Hot.</i>)</h3>

<p>3 even table-spoonfuls arrowroot.</p>

<p>1 quart new milk.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful butter.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls sugar.</p>

<p>4 eggs, beaten light.</p>

<p>A little nutmeg.</p>

<p>Vanilla flavoring.</p>

<p>Scald the milk; wet the arrowroot with cold milk,
and pour the hot gradually upon it, stirring all the
time. Beat the eggs very light, rub butter and sugar
together; mix with the eggs; whisk hard for a minute
before pouring the milk in with them. Flavor; put
into a buttered mould. The water should be nearly
boiling when it goes in, and boil steadily for one hour.
If you have a steamer, it is best cooked in that, the
heat reaching all parts of the covered mould at the
same time. Set in cold water a minute before turning
it out. Eat with brandy or wine sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sago Pudding.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 small cup of sago, soaked over night in cold water.</p>

<p>1 quart of milk.</p>

<p>5 eggs.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls of sugar.</p>

<p>A pinch of cinnamon, and same of nutmeg.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of butter.</p>

<p>In the morning put the soaked sago into a farina-kettle,
with one pint of milk; bring to a slow boil, and
keep it on the fire until it is tender and clear, and has
soaked up all the milk. Make a custard of the beaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
eggs, the milk, the butter and sugar rubbed together,
the spice, and when the sago is nearly cold, beat it in.
Bake in a buttered dish. It should be done in little
over half an hour.</p>

<p>You can boil the same mixture, if desired, in a
buttered mould. It will take more than an hour to
cook.</p>

<p>Eat cold or hot. If warm, with sauce. If cold,
with powdered sugar and cream. It is nice with a
<i>méringue</i> on top.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Almond Corn-Starch Pudding.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls corn-starch.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of butter.</p>

<p>Yolks of five eggs, whites of two.</p>

<p>¼ pound sweet almonds—blanched.</p>

<p>Rose-water, and bitter almond.</p>

<p>¾ cup powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Scald the milk; wet the corn-starch to smooth paste
with a little cold milk, and stir into the boiling milk. Cook
until it begins to thicken well. Take from the fire and
stir in the butter. Let it cool while you make the
almond paste and the custard. The almonds should
be blanched long enough beforehand to get perfectly
cold before you pound them to a paste, a few at a time,
in a bowl or Wedgewood mortar. Drop in rose-water,
now and then, to prevent them from oiling. Make a
custard of the yolks, the whites of two eggs, and the
sugar. Beat this gradually and thoroughly into the
corn-starch paste; flavor with bitter almond; finally
stir in the almond paste. Bake in a buttered dish about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
half an hour. When almost done cover with a <i>méringue</i>
made of the whites reserved, and a very little
powdered sugar. Eat warm—not hot, with cream
and sugar. It is also good when it has been set on
the ice until <i>very</i> cold. In winter it is easy to freeze
it. It is then delicious, eaten with rich cream or custard.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn-Meal Fruit Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>3 pints of milk.</p>

<p>1 <i>heaping</i> cup white Indian meal.</p>

<p>1 cup flour.</p>

<p>4 eggs, well beaten.</p>

<p>1 cup white sugar.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls butter, melted.</p>

<p>½ pound raisins, seeded, and cut in two.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful, heaping, of salt.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful mixed cinnamon and mace.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful soda, wet up with boiling water.</p>

<p>2 teaspoonfuls cream of tartar, sifted in the flour.</p>

<p>Scald a pint of the milk, and with it wet the meal.
Stir it up well, and let it get almost, or quite cold.
While cooling, beat in the flour wet with cold milk.
Beat all up <i>hard</i> and long. Make a custard of the remaining
milk, the eggs and sugar. Beat gradually
into the cooled paste. When all are mixed into a
light batter, put in the butter, spice, the fruit, dredged
well with flour; last of all, the dissolved soda. Beat
up hard and quickly, bringing your spoon up from the
bottom of the dish, and full of batter at every stroke.
Pour into a buttered dish, and bake in a tolerably
quick, steady oven. It should be done in from half to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
three-quarters of an hour, if the heat be just right. If
it should brown too rapidly, cover with paper.</p>

<p>This is a very good pudding.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn-Meal Pudding without Eggs.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 cups Indian meal.</p>

<p>1 cup flour.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls sugar (or molasses).</p>

<p>3 cups sour milk—if thick, all the better.</p>

<p>1 great spoonful melted butter.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful—a <i>full</i> one—of soda.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful cinnamon.</p>

<p>Put meal and flour together in a bowl, and mix
them up well with the salt. Make a hole in the middle,
and pour in the milk, stirring the meal, etc., down
into it from the sides gradually. Beat until free from
lumps. Put in butter, spice and sugar—the soda, dissolved
in hot water, at the last. Beat up well for five
minutes. Butter a tin mould with a cover; pour in
the batter and boil steadily for an hour and a half.</p>

<p>Eat hot with sweet sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hasty Pudding.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 heaping cup of Indian meal.</p>

<p>½ cup flour.</p>

<p>1 quart boiling water.</p>

<p>1 pint milk.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful butter.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful salt.</p>

<p>Wet up meal and flour with the milk and stir into
the boiling water. Boil hard half an hour, stirring almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
constantly from the bottom. Put in salt and
butter, and simmer ten minutes longer. Turn into a
deep, uncovered dish, and eat with sugar and cream,
or sugar and butter with nutmeg.</p>

<p>Our children like it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice-Flour Hasty Pudding.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 quart new milk.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls rice-flour.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful butter.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful salt.</p>

<p>Scald the milk and stir into it the rice flour, wet up
with cold milk. Boil steadily, stirring all the while,
for half an hour. Add salt and butter; let the pudding
stand in hot water three minutes after you have
ceased to stir, and turn out into deep, open dish.</p>

<p>Eat with cream and sugar.</p>

<p>N. B. <i>Always</i> boil hasty puddings and custards in
a farina-kettle, or a pail set within a pot of hot water.
It is the only safe method.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Farina Pudding.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Make according to last receipt, but boil three-quarters
of an hour, and, ten minutes before taking it up,
stir into it two eggs beaten light and thinned with
three table-spoonfuls of milk. Cook slowly, and stir
all the time, after these go in. To a quart of milk,
use at least four table-spoonfuls of farina.</p>

<p>A good dessert for children—and not to be despised
by their elders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Susie’s Bread Pudding.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk.</p>

<p>4 eggs—the whites of 3 more for <i>méringue</i>.</p>

<p>2 cups very fine, dry bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful melted butter.</p>

<p>1 teacupful sugar.</p>

<p>Juice and half the grated peel of 1 lemon.</p>

<p>Beat eggs, sugar and butter together. Soak the
crumbs in the milk and mix all well, beating very
hard and rapidly. Season, and bake in greased baking-dish.
When almost done, cover with a <i>méringue</i>
made of the whites of three eggs and a little powdered
sugar.</p>

<p>Eat cold. It is very nice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fruit Bread Pudding.</span> (<i>Very Fine.</i>) <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk.</p>

<p>1 cup of sugar.</p>

<p>3 <i>large</i> cups very fine bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>½ cup suet—powdered.</p>

<p>½ pound raisins seeded and cut in two.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful finely shred citron.</p>

<p>½ pound sultana raisins, washed well and dried.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful soda, dissolved in hot water.</p>

<p>2 teaspoonfuls cream of tartar, stirred into the dry crumbs.</p>

<p>A little salt, nutmeg and cinnamon.</p>

<p>3 eggs beaten light.</p>

<p>Soak the bread-crumbs in the milk; next, beat in
the whipped eggs and sugar; the suet and spice.
Whip the batter very light before the fruit—strictly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
dredged with flour and well mixed—goes in. Put the
soda in last. Beat three minutes steadily, before putting
it into buttered mould. Boil two hours. Keep
the water boiling hard all the time. Eat with brandy-sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bread and Raisin Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart milk.</p>

<p>Enough slices of baker’s bread—stale—to fill your dish.</p>

<p>Butter to spread the bread.</p>

<p>4 eggs.</p>

<p>½ cup of sugar.</p>

<p>¾ pound of raisins, seeded and each cut into three pieces.</p>

<p>Butter the bread, each slice of which should be an
inch thick, and entirely free from crust. Make a raw
custard of eggs, sugar and milk. Butter a pudding-dish
and put a layer of sliced bread at the bottom,
fitted closely together and cut to fit the dish. Pour a
little custard upon this, strew the cut raisins evenly
over it; and lay in more buttered bread. Proceed in
this order until the dish is full. The uppermost layer
should be bread well buttered and soaked in the custard.
Cover the dish closely, set in a baking pan
nearly full of hot water, and bake an hour. When
done, uncover, and brown lightly.</p>

<h4><i>Or,</i></h4>

<p>You can spread with a <i>méringue</i>, just before taking
from the oven.</p>

<p>Eat hot, with sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cherry Bread Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>Is very good made as above, substituting nice dried
cherries—without stones—for the raisins.</p>

<p>Both of these are more palatable than one would
imagine from reading the receipts; are far more easily
made, less expensive, and more digestible than the
pie, “without which father wouldn’t think he could
live.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Willie’s Favorite.</span> (<i>Very good.</i>)</h3>

<p>1 loaf stale baker’s bread. French bread, if you can get it. It <i>must</i> be white and light.</p>

<p>½ cup suet, powdered.</p>

<p>¼ pound citron, chopped <i>very</i> fine.</p>

<p>½ pound sweet almonds blanched and shaved thin.</p>

<p>5 large pippins, pared, cored and chopped.</p>

<p>1 cup cream and same of milk.</p>

<p>A little salt, stirred into the cream.</p>

<p>1 cup of powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Cut the bread into slices an inch thick, and pare off
the crust. Cover the bottom of a buttered mould
(with plain sides) with these, trimming them to fit
the mould and to lie closely together. Soak this
layer with cream; spread with the suet, and this with
the fruit chopped fine and mixed together. Sprinkle
this well with sugar, and strew almond shavings over
it. Fit on another stratum of bread; soaking this
with <i>milk;</i> then suet, fruit, sugar, almonds, and
another layer of bread wet with cream. The topmost
layer must be bread, and <i>very</i> wet. Boil two hours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Dip the mould in cold water, and turn out carefully
upon a dish. Sift powdered sugar over it.</p>

<p>Eat hot with sweet sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Steamed Bread Pudding.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 pint milk.</p>

<p>2 cups fine bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>½ pound sultana raisins, picked, washed and dried.</p>

<p>½ pound macaroons or ratifias.</p>

<p>Make a custard of milk, eggs and sugar; heat almost
to a boil and stir in the corn-starch wet with
milk. Cook one minute; take from the fire and pour,
a little at a time, over the bread-crumbs; beating into
a rather thick batter. Butter a mould thickly; line it
with the macaroons, and put, spoonful by spoonful, a
layer of batter in the bottom. Cover this with suet,
then raisins; sprinkle with sugar—put in more batter,
and so on until the mould is nearly full. Fit on the
top; put into the steamer over a pot of boiling water
and steam, with the water at a hard boil, at least two
hours. Dip the mould into cold water to make the
pudding leave the sides; let it stand a moment, and
turn out, with care, upon a hot dish.</p>

<p>Eat hot with wine sauce.</p>

<p>2 cupfuls fine bread-crumbs—stale and dry.</p>

<p>1 quart of milk.</p>

<p>6 eggs—whites and yolks beaten separately.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful rice flour.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful salt, and ½ teaspoonful soda.</p>

<p>Flavor to taste.</p>

<p>Soak the bread-crumbs in the milk; put into a
farina-kettle and heat almost to a boil. Stir in the
rice-flour wet with cold milk; cook one minute; turn
into a basin and beat hard several minutes. When

Turn out, and eat hot with sweet sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni and Almond Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>½ pound best Italian macaroni, broken into inch lengths.</p>

<p>3 pints milk.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls butter.</p>

<p>1 cup white sugar.</p>

<p>5 eggs.</p>

<p>½ pound sweet almonds, blanched and chopped.</p>

<p>Rose-water and bitter almond flavoring.</p>

<p>A little salt and nutmeg.</p>

<p>Simmer the macaroni half an hour in a pint of the
milk.</p>

<p>Stir in the butter and salt. Cover the saucepan, and
take from the fire, letting it stand covered while you
make a custard of the rest of the milk, the eggs and
sugar. Chop the almonds, adding rose-water to keep
them from oiling. When the macaroni is nearly cold,
put into the custard; stir up well, but break it as little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
as possible; put in nutmeg, bitter-almond extract;
lastly the almonds.</p>

<p>Bake in the dish in which it is to be served.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Plain Macaroni Pudding.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>¼ pound macaroni, broken into pieces an inch long.</p>

<p>1 pint water.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful butter.</p>

<p>1 large cup of milk.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Grated peel of half a lemon.</p>

<p>A little cinnamon and salt.</p>

<p>Boil the macaroni slowly in the water, in one vessel
set within another of hot water, until it is tender and
has soaked up the water. Add the butter and salt.
Let it stand covered five minutes without removing it
from the range; put in the rest of the ingredients.
Stir frequently, taking care not to break the macaroni,
and simmer, covered ten minutes longer before
turning it out into a deep dish.</p>

<p>Eat hot with butter and sugar, or sugar and cream.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Essex Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>2 cups fine bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>¾ cup powdered suet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls sago, soaked over night in a little water.</p>

<p>5 eggs, beaten light.</p>

<p>1 cup of milk.</p>

<p>1 cup of sugar.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful corn-starch, wet in cold milk.</p>

<p>About ½ pound whole raisins, “plumped” by laying them in <i>boiling</i> water two minutes.</p>

<p>A little salt.</p>

<p>Set the sago over the fire in a farina-kettle with
enough water to cover it, and let it cook gently until
tender and nearly dry. Make a custard of the eggs,
milk and sugar; add the crumbs, beating into a thick
batter; next the suet, corn-starch, sago and salt. Beat
all up long and hard.</p>

<p>Butter a mould <i>very</i> thickly, and lay the raisins in
the bottom and sides, in rings or stripes, or whatever
pattern you may fancy. Fill the mould by spoonfuls—not
to spoil your pattern—with the batter. Steam
one hour and a half, or boil one hour.</p>

<p>Dip in cold water; let it stand one minute, and
turn out upon a flat dish. The raisins should be imbedded
in the pudding, but distinctly visible upon the
surface.</p>

<p>Eat with jelly sauce.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Apple Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>6 <i>large</i> juicy apples, pared, cored and chopped.</p>

<p>2 cups fine bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>1 cup powdered suet.</p>

<p>Juice of 1 lemon, and half the peel.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful of soda dissolved in hot water.</p>

<p>Mix all together with a wooden spoon, stirring until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the ingredients are well incorporated into a damp
mass. Put into a buttered mould, and boil three hours.</p>

<p>Eat with a good, sweet sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Apple Pudding.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>6 or 7 fine juicy apples, pared and sliced.</p>

<p>Slices of stale baker’s bread, buttered.</p>

<p>½ pound citron, shred thin.</p>

<p>Grated peel of half a lemon, and a little cinnamon.</p>

<p>1 cup light, brown sugar.</p>

<p>Cut the crust from the bread; butter it on both
sides, and fit a layer in the bottom of a buttered mould.
Lay sliced apple over this, sprinkle with citron; strew
sugar and a little of the seasoning over all, and put the
next layer of bread. The slices of bread should be not
quite half an inch thick. Butter the uppermost layer
very abundantly. Cover the mould or dish, and bake
an hour and a half.</p>

<p>Turn out and eat with pudding-sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Batter Pudding.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>6 or 8 fine juicy apples, pared and cored.</p>

<p>1 quart of milk.</p>

<p>10 table-spoonfuls of flour.</p>

<p>6 eggs, beaten very light.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful butter—melted.</p>

<p>1 saltspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful soda.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful cream of tartar.</p>

<p>Set the apples closely together in the baking-dish;
put in enough cold water to half cover them, and bake,
closely covered, until the edges are clear, but not until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
they begin to break. Drain off the water, and let the
fruit get cold before pouring over them a batter made
of the ingredients enumerated above. Bake in a quick
oven.</p>

<p>Serve in the baking-dish, and eat with sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peach Batter Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>This is made in the same way, but if the peaches are
fully ripe and soft, they need no previous cooking.
The stones must be left in.</p>

<p>This is a delightful pudding.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peach Léche Créma.</span></h3>

<p>Some fine, ripe peaches pared, and cut in half, leaving out the stones.</p>

<p>3 eggs, and the whites of two more.</p>

<p>3 cups of milk.</p>

<p>½ cup powdered sugar.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls corn-starch, or rice-flour. If you have neither, take 3 table-spoonfuls best family flour.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful melted butter.</p>

<p>Scald the milk; stir in the corn-starch wet with cold
milk. Simmer, stirring carefully until it begins to
thicken. Take from the fire and put in the butter.
Beat the eggs light, and add when the corn-starch is
lukewarm. Whip all until light and smooth. Put a
thick substratum of peaches in the bottom of a buttered
baking-dish; strew with the sugar and pour the créma
gently over them. Bake in a pretty quick oven ten
minutes. Then spread with a méringue made of the
whites of five eggs, whisked stiff with a little powdered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
sugar. Shut the oven-door for two minutes to harden
this.</p>

<p>Eat warm with sauce, or cold with cream.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ristori Puffs.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>5 eggs.</p>

<p>The weight of the eggs in flour.</p>

<p>Half their weight in butter and in sugar.</p>

<p>Juice of 1 lemon, and half the grated peel.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful soda, dissolved in hot water.</p>

<p>Rub the butter and sugar to a cream, whisking until
it is very light. Beat the whites to a standing froth;
the yolks thick and smooth. Strain the latter through
a sieve into the butter and sugar; stir in well; add the
lemon, the soda, and the flour alternately with the
whites, beating up rapidly after these go in. Have
ready small cups or muffin-rings, well-buttered; put
the mixture into them, and bake at once. In less than
half an hour they should rise high in the pans. Test
with a clean straw to see if they are done; turn out
upon a hot dish, and serve with jelly sauce.</p>

<p>These are almost sure to be a success if made with
<i>good</i> prepared flour—Hecker’s, for example. In this
case, use no soda.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jam Puffs.</span></h3>

<p>3 eggs.</p>

<p>Half a cup of sweet jam or jelly.</p>

<p>The weight of the eggs in Hecker’s prepared flour.</p>

<p>Half their weight in sugar and butter.</p>

<p>Beat the eggs stiff, whites and yolks separately.</p>

<p>Cream the butter and sugar, strain the yolks into the
cream; beat well before putting in the whites. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
flour should go in last. Put the mixture in great
spoonfuls upon your baking-tin. They should not
touch, and must be as uniform in size as you can make
them. Bake fifteen minutes in a quick oven. When
cold, run a sharp knife around each, leaving about an
inch uncut to serve as a hinge. Pull far enough open
to put in a spoonful of jelly or jam; close, and sift
white sugar over all when they are filled.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cottage Puffs.</span></h3>

<p>1 cup milk, and same of cream.</p>

<p>4 eggs beaten stiff, and the yolks strained.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful butter, chopped into the flour.</p>

<p>A very little salt.</p>

<p>Enough prepared flour for thick batter.</p>

<p>Mix the beaten yolks with the milk and cream; then
the salt and whites, lastly the flour. Bake in buttered
iron pans, such as are used for “gems” and corn-bread.
The oven should be quick. Turn out and eat with
sweet sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon Puffs.</span></h3>

<p>1 cup of prepared flour. Hecker’s <i>always</i>, if procurable.</p>

<p>½ cup powdered sugar.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful butter.</p>

<p>3 eggs, beaten stiff. Strain the yolks.</p>

<p>A little salt, and grated peel of 1 lemon.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls milk.</p>

<p>Mix, and bake in little pans as directed in previous
receipt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Vanilla Cream Puffs.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 cup boiling water.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls butter.</p>

<p>1 cup prepared flour.</p>

<p>2 eggs—beaten well.</p>

<p>1 cup powdered sugar and }</p>

<p>Whites of 2 eggs,        } for icing.</p>

<p>1 pint cream whipped with a little sugar.</p>

<p>Vanilla seasoning in cream.</p>

<p>Put the water over the fire with one table-spoonful
of butter. Boil up, and work in the flour without removing
from the fire. Stir until stiff, and work in the
rest of the butter. Take from the range, turn out into
a bowl and beat in the eggs. Put upon a greased baking-tin
in table-spoonfuls, taking care not to let them
touch. Bake quickly, but thoroughly. When done
and cold, cut a round piece out of the bottom of each,
introduce the handle of a teaspoon, and scrape out most
of the inside. Fill the cavity with the whipped cream
into which you have beaten two table-spoonfuls of icing;
fit back the round piece taken from the bottom; set
on a dish, and ice. Put into a quick oven one minute
to dry.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coffee Cream Puffs.</span></h3>

<p>Make as above, but beat into the icing two table-spoonfuls
of black coffee—as strong as can be made,
and a little of this icing into the whipped cream.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Cream Puffs.</span></h3>

<p>Instead of coffee, season the cream and icing with 2
table-spoonfuls sweet chocolate, grated. That flavored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
with vanilla is best. If you have not this, add a little
vanilla extract.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn-Meal Puffs.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart boiling milk.</p>

<p>2 scant cups white “corn flour.”</p>

<p>½ cup wheat flour.</p>

<p>1 scant cup powdered sugar.</p>

<p>A little salt.</p>

<p>4 eggs—beaten light.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful butter.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in hot water.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful cream of tartar, sifted into flour.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful mixed cinnamon and nutmeg.</p>

<p>Boil the milk, and stir into it the meal, flour and
salt. Boil fifteen minutes, stirring well up from the
bottom. Put in the butter and beat hard in a bowl
for three minutes. When cold, put in the eggs whipped
light with the sugar, the seasoning and soda.
Whip up very faithfully; bake in greased cups in a
steady oven.</p>

<p>Turn out of cups and eat with pudding sauce, or
with butter alone.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">White Puffs</span> (<i>Very nice</i>).</h3>

<p>1 pint rich milk.</p>

<p>Whites of 4 eggs whipped stiff.</p>

<p>1 heaping cup prepared flour.</p>

<p>1 scant cup powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Grated peel of ½ lemon.</p>

<p>A little salt.</p>

<p>Whisk the eggs and sugar to a méringue, and add
this alternately with the flour to the milk. (If you
have cream, or half cream half milk, it is better.)
Beat until the mixture is very light, and bake in buttered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
cups or tins. Turn out, sift powdered sugar
over them, and eat with lemon sauce.</p>

<p>These are delicate in texture and taste, and pleasing
to the eye.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">White Pudding.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>3 cups of milk.</p>

<p>Whites of 6 eggs—whipped stiff.</p>

<p>1 cup powdered sugar.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful melted butter.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful rose-water.</p>

<p>2 heaping cups prepared flour.</p>

<p>Whip the sugar into the stiffened whites; add butter
and rose-water; then the flour, stirred in very
lightly.</p>

<p>Bake in buttered mould in a rather quick oven.
Eat with sweet sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rusk Pudding.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>8 light, stale rusk.</p>

<p>A little more than 1 quart of milk.</p>

<p>5 eggs—whites and yolks beaten separately.</p>

<p>½ cup powdered sugar, ½ teaspoonful soda.</p>

<p>Flavor to taste, with lemon, vanilla or bitter almond.</p>

<p>Pare every bit of the crust from the rusk, wasting as
little as possible. Crumb them fine into a bowl and
pour a pint of milk boiling hot over them. Cover and
let them stand until cold. Make a raw custard of the
rest of the milk, the eggs and the sugar. Stir the
soda, dissolved in hot water, into the soaked rusk,
when they are cold, put in the custard. Pour the
mixture into a buttered baking-dish—the same in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
which it is to be served—and bake in a brisk oven. It
should puff up very light.</p>

<p>Sift powdered sugar over the top and eat warm
with sweet sauce. Cream sauce is particularly good
with it.</p>

<p>This is a good way to use up stale buns, rusk, etc.
But they must be really good at first, or the pudding
will be a failure. Rusks soon dry out, and become
comparatively tasteless. <i>Never</i> try to renew their
youth by steaming them. You will only make them
as sour and flat as a twice-told tale.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fig Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>½ pound best Naples figs, washed, dried and minced.</p>

<p>2 cups fine bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>3 eggs.</p>

<p>½ cup best suet, powdered.</p>

<p>2 scant cups of milk.</p>

<p>½ cup white sugar.</p>

<p>A little salt.</p>

<p>A pinch of soda, dissolved in hot water and stirred into the milk.</p>

<p>Soak the crumbs in the milk; stir in the eggs beaten
light with the sugar, the salt, suet and figs. Beat three
minutes; put in buttered mould and boil three hours.</p>

<p>Eat hot with wine sauce. It is very good.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fig Custard Pudding.</span></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>1 pound best white figs.</p>

<p>1 quart of milk.</p>

<p>Yolks of 5 eggs, and whites of two.</p>

<p>½ package of gelatine, soaked in a little cold water.</p>

<p>1 cup <i>made</i> wine jelly—lukewarm.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls sugar.</p>

<p>Flavor to taste.</p>

<p>Soak the figs for a few minutes in warm water to
make them pliable. Split them in two, dip each piece
in jelly, and line the inside of a buttered mould with
them. Make a custard of the milk, yolks and sugar;
boil until it begins to thicken well; take off the fire
and let it cool. Meanwhile, beat the whites of two
eggs to a stiff froth; melt the soaked gelatine in a <i>very</i>
little hot water, by setting the vessel containing this
in a saucepan of boiling water; stir until clear. Turn
out to cool. When nearly cold, whip gradually into
the whisked eggs. The mixture should be white and
thick before you stir it into the custard. Whip all
rapidly for a few minutes, and fill the fig-lined mould.
Set on ice, or in a cold place to form.</p>

<p>Dip the mould in hot water, to loosen the pudding,
and turn out upon a cold dish.</p>

<h4><i>Or,</i></h4>

<p>Besides lining the mould with figs, you may chop
some very fine and mix in with the custard before
moulding it.</p>

<p>This pudding is delicious if made with fresh, ripe
figs.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Marrow Sponge Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>2 cups fine sponge-cake crumbs—made from stale cake—the drier the better.</p>

<p>½ cup beef marrow, finely minced.</p>

<p>Juice of 1 lemon and half the grated peel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>½ cup white sugar.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful grated nutmeg.</p>

<p>½ pound fresh layer raisins, seeded and chopped.</p>

<p>¼ pound citron, minced.</p>

<p>1 cup milk.</p>

<p>4 eggs—beaten light—strain the yolks.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful flour, and a little salt.</p>

<p>Mix the powdered marrow with the crumbs. Make
a raw custard of milk, eggs, and sugar, and pour over
the cake. Beat well; put in the flour, seasoning,
lastly, the fruit very thickly dredged with flour. Stir
hard before pouring into a greased mould. Boil three
hours. Turn out and eat hot, with cabinet-pudding
sauce.</p>

<p>Be sure that the water actually boils before you put in
a pudding, and do not let it stop boiling for an instant
until it is done. Replenish from the boiling tea-kettle.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Plain Sponge-Cake Pudding.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 stale sponge-cake.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls sugar.</p>

<p>4 eggs—beaten light.</p>

<p>2 cups of milk.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful rice-flour or corn-starch wet up with cold milk.</p>

<p>Juice of 1 lemon and half the grated rind.</p>

<p>Slice the cake and lay some in the bottom of a buttered
dish. Make a custard of the milk boiled for a
minute with the corn-starch in it. Flavor to taste
when you have added the eggs and sugar; pour over
the cake; put another layer of slices; more custard,
and so on, until the mould is full. Let it stand a few
minutes, to soak up the custard; put the dish in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
oven—covered—and bake half an hour. Uncover a
few minutes before you take from the oven and brown
slightly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cocoanut Sponge pudding.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 cup of white sugar.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful rose-water.</p>

<p>1 glass white wine.</p>

<p>Heat the milk to boiling; stir in the crumbed cake
and beat into a soft batter. When nearly cold, add
the beaten eggs, sugar, rose-water and cocoanut—the
wine last. Bake in a buttered pudding-dish about
three-quarters of an hour, or until it is firm in the
centre and of a nice brown. Eat cold, with white
sugar sifted over the top.</p>

<p>You can make an elegant dessert of this by spreading
it with a méringue made of—</p>

<p>Whipped whites of 4 eggs.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls powdered sugar.</p>

will swell a little. Fit on the cover, and boil one
hour.</p>

<p>Eat cold or hot. If the latter, serve jelly-sauce with
it. If cold, turn out of the mould the day after it is
boiled, and sift powdered sugar over it. Pile a nice
“whip” about the base.</p>

<p>2 cups boiling milk.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of butter.</p>

<p>Soak the crumbs in the milk (raw), whip up light
and add the eggs and sugar, already beaten to a cream
with the batter. Next the corn-starch, and when your
mould is buttered and water boiling hard, stir in the
juice and peel of the fruit. Do this quickly, and
plunge the mould directly into the hot water. Boil
one hour; turn out and eat with very sweet brandy
sauce.</p>

<p>4 eggs—whipped light.</p>

<p>1 cup of milk—a large one.</p>

<p>Soak the bread-crumbs in the milk; add the suet;
beat eggs and sugar together and these well into the
soaked bread. To these put the lemon, lastly the
flour, beaten in with as few strokes as will suffice to
mix up all into a thick batter. Boil three hours in a
buttered mould.</p>

<p>1 lemon—the juice and half the grated peel.</p>

<p>⅛ pound citron, cut into long strips—very thin.</p>

<p>5 eggs—whites and yolks beaten light separately.</p>

<p>Rub butter and sugar to a cream, and strain into
this the beaten yolks. Whip up light with the lemon;
then the flour, alternately with the stiff whites. The
raisins should be dredged with flour and go in last.
Butter a mould thickly, line it with the strips of citron;
put in the batter, a few spoonfuls at a time; cover,
and set in a pan of boiling water in the oven. Keep
the water in the pan replenished from the boiling kettle,
and bake steadily an hour and a half. Turn out
upon hot plate.</p>

<p>Eat warm with brandy sauce. It is a delicious pudding.
Leave room in mould for the pudding to swell.</p>

<p>4 eggs—beaten very light.</p>

<p>The weight of the eggs in sugar and the weight of 5 eggs in prepared flour.</p>

<p>Half the weight of 4 in butter.</p>

<p>¼ pound sweet almonds blanched and pounded.</p>

<p>Extract of bitter almond.</p>

<p>A little rose-water.</p>

<p>Rub butter and sugar to a light cream; add the
yolks and beat hard before putting in the whites alternately
with the flour. The almonds, pounded to a
paste with a little rose-water and bitter almond extract,
should be put in last.</p>

<p>Boil in buttered mould; or set in a pan of water as
directed in the last receipt. The mould should not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls butter, } rubbed to a cream.</p>

<p>Juice of one lemon.</p>

<p>Whipped white of 1 egg.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful nutmeg.</p>

<p>Beat all well together.</p>

<p>If you have not an open mould, make this sauce, and
pour half over the pudding, sending the rest in a boat
to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boston Orange Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>Is made in the same way, substituting oranges for lemons
in the pudding, but retaining the lemon in the sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Both of these are excellent desserts, and if the directions
be strictly followed, are easy and safe to make.
Either can be baked as well as boiled.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Queen’s Pudding.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>8 or 10 fine, juicy apples, pared and cored.</p>

<p>½ pound macaroons, pounded fine.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls sugar.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful cinnamon.</p>

<p>A little salt.</p>

<p>Put the apples into a pudding-dish, well buttered;
fill half full of water; cover closely and steam in a
slow oven until so tender that a straw will pierce them.
Let them stand until cold, covered. Then drain off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the water. Put into each apple a spoonful of jelly, and
a few drops of brandy; sprinkle with cinnamon and
sugar. Cover again and leave alone for ten minutes.
Scald the milk, and stir in the macaroons, the salt, the
flour, wet in a little cold milk. Boil all together one
minute. Take from the fire; beat for a few minutes,
and let it cool before whipping in the beaten whites.
Pour over the apples, and bake half an hour in a moderate
oven.</p>

<p>Eat hot with cream sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Orange Custard Pudding.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 quart milk.</p>

<p>5 eggs. The beaten yolks of all, the whites of two.</p>

<p>Grated peel of 1 orange.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls powdered sugar for custard, and 2 spoonfuls for <i>méringue</i>.</p>

<p>Scald the milk, and pour carefully over the eggs
which you have beaten light with the sugar. Boil one
minute, season, and pour into a buttered pudding-dish.
Set this in a pan of boiling water, and bake about half
an hour, or until well “set.” Spread with a <i>méringue</i>
made of the reserved whites. Return to oven to
harden, but do not let it scorch.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful rice-flour, wet up with cold water.</p>

<p>A little salt.</p>

<p>Vanilla flavoring.</p>

<p>Boil the milk; beat up the yolks of the eggs with three-quarters
of the sugar; cook in the milk until the mixture
is smoking hot; stir in the rice-flour, salt, and boil just
one minute. Pour into a buttered baking-dish, and
bake in a pan of hot water until the custard is nearly,
but not quite “set.” Have ready the whites beaten
very stiff with the rest of the sugar, and flavored with
vanilla. Without drawing the dish from the oven, drop
this all over it in great spoonfuls, covering it as irregularly
as possible. Do it quickly, lest the custard
should cool and fall. Shut the oven-door for about five
minutes more until the <i>méringue</i> is delicately browned
and the custard firm.</p>

<p>Eat cold, with powdered sugar sifted over it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Nursery Plum Pudding.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 scant cup of raw rice.</p>

<p>3 pints rich milk.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls butter.</p>

<p>½ pound currants, washed and dried.</p>

<p>¼ pound raisins, stoned and cut in two.</p>

<p>3 well-beaten eggs.</p>

<p>Soak the rice two hours in just enough warm water
to cover it; setting the vessel containing it in another
of hot water on one side of the range. When all the
water is soaked up, shake the rice well and add a pint
of milk. Simmer gently, still in the saucepan of hot
water until the rice is again dry and quite tender.
Shake up anew, and add another pint of milk. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
soon as this is smoking hot, put in the fruit, well
dredged with flour; cover the saucepan and simmer
twenty minutes. Take from the fire and put with it
the butter, the rice-flour and a custard made of the
remaining pint of milk, the eggs and sugar. Add
while the rice is still hot; stir up well and bake in a

<p>Nutmeg and rose-water to taste.</p>

<p>Soak the crumbs in the milk; rub the butter and

up this mixture with the soaked crumbs; stir in the
corn-starch; then the whisked whites, flavoring, and,

<h3><span class="smcap">Impromptu Christmas Pudding.</span> (<i>Very fine.</i>)</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>2 cups of best mince meat made for Christmas pies. Drain off all superfluous moisture. If the meat be rather too dry for pies, it will make the better pudding.</p>

<p>1½ cups prepared flour.</p>

<p>6 eggs—whites and yolks beaten separately.</p>

<p>Whip the eggs and stir the yolks into the mince-meat.
Beat them in hard for two or three minutes until thoroughly
incorporated. Put in the whites and the flour,
alternately beating in each instalment before adding
the next. Butter a large mould very well; put in the
mixture, leaving room for the swelling of the pudding,
and boil five hours steadily. If the boiling should
intermit one minute, there will be a heavy streak in
the pudding. Six hours’ boiling will do no harm.</p>

<p>Turn out upon a hot dish; pour brandy over it and
light just as it goes into the dining-room. Eat with
rich sauce. I know of no other pudding of equal excellence
that can be made with so little trouble as this,
and is as apt to “turn out well.”</p>

<p>If you have no mince-meat in the house, you can
buy an admirable article, ready made, at any first-class
grocery store. It is put up in neat wooden cans (which
are stanch and useful for holding eggs, starch, etc.,
after the mince-meat is used up) and bears the stamp,
“<span class="smcap">Atmore’s Celebrated Mince Meat</span>.”</p>

<p>And what is noteworthy, it deserves to be “celebrated.”
It has never been my good fortune to meet
with any other <i>made</i> mince-meat that could compare
with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon Soufflé Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls of sugar.</p>

<p>5 eggs—whites and yolks beaten separately and very light.</p>

<p>Chop the butter into the flour. Scald the milk and
stir into it while still over the fire, the flour and butter.
When it begins to thicken, add it, gradually, to the
beaten yolks and sugar. Beat all up well and turn out
to cool in a broad dish. It should be cold when you
whip in the stiffened whites. Butter a mould; pour
in the mixture, leaving abundance of room for the
<i>soufflé</i> to earn its name—and steam one hour and a half,
keeping the water under the steamer at a fast, hard
boil.</p>

<p>When done, dip it into cold water for an instant, let
it stand one minute, after you take it out of this, and
turn out upon a hot dish.</p>

<p>Eat with brandy sauce.</p>

<p>½ pound crystallized or <i>glacé</i> cherries.</p>

<p>A pinch of salt.</p>

<p>Scald the milk, and stir into it the flour, wet up
with a cup of the milk. Boil one minute, stirring well
up from the bottom of the farina-kettle; mix in the
yolks beaten light with the sugar, flavor, and let it get
perfectly cold. Then whip the whites until you can
cut them with a knife, and beat, fast and hard, into
the custard. Butter a mould thickly; strew with the
cherries until the inside is pretty well covered; put in
the mixture—leaving room for puffing—and boil for
an hour and a half.</p>

<p>Dip into cold water; take it out and let it stand, after
the lid is removed, a full minute, before turning it out.</p>

yolks of the eggs, beaten and strained, and half the
sugar. Return to the fire, and stir until quite thick.
Pour this upon the soaked cakes, slowly, that they may
not rise to the top; put in the oven, and when it is

<p>Nutmeg and a little grated lemon-peel.</p>

<p>Pare, core and slice the apples, and stew in a covered
farina-kettle, without a drop of water, until they are
tender. Mash to a smooth pulp, and, while hot, stir in
butter and sugar. Let it get quite cold, and whip in,
first the yolks of the eggs, then the whites—beaten
<i>very</i> stiff—alternately with the bread-crumbs. Flavor,
beat hard three minutes, until all the ingredients are

<p>Eat warm with “bee-hive sauce.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice Soufflé Pudding.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>½ cup raw rice.</p>

<p>1 pint of milk.</p>

<p>6 eggs.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls powdered sugar.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful butter.</p>

<p>Soak the rice in warm water enough to cover it
well for two hours. Put it over the fire in the same
water, and simmer in a farina-kettle until the rice is
dry. Add the milk, shaking up the rice—<i>not</i> stirring
it—and cook slowly, covered, until tender throughout.
Stir in the butter, then the yolks of the eggs, beaten
and strained, whatever flavoring you may desire, and
when these have cooled somewhat, the whipped whites.
Bake in a handsome pudding-dish, well buttered, half
an hour.</p>

<p>Eat warm—not hot—or <i>very</i> cold.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Arrowroot Soufflé Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>3 cups of milk.</p>

<p>5 eggs.</p>

<p>1 large table-spoonful butter.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls sugar.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls Bermuda arrowroot, wet up with cold milk.</p>

<p>Vanilla or other flavoring.</p>

<p>Heat the milk to a boil, and stir into this the arrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>root.
Simmer, using your spoon freely all the time,
until it thickens up well. Put in the butter; take
from the fire and beat into it the yolks and sugar, previously
whipped together. Stir hard and put in the
whites, whisked <i>very</i> stiff, and the flavoring.</p>

<p>Butter a neat baking-dish; put in the mixture and
bake half an hour.</p>

<p>Sift powdered sugar over it, and serve immediately.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A very Delicate Soufflé.</span></h3>

<p>5 eggs—whites and yolks beaten separately.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls of arrowroot wet up in 4 table-spoonfuls cold water.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Rose-water flavoring.</p>

<p>Beat the sugar into the whipped yolks, and into the
whites, little by little, the dissolved arrowroot. Flavor
and whisk all together. Butter a neat mould, pour in
the mixture until half way to the top, and bake half
an hour.</p>

<p>If quite firm, and if you have a steady hand, you
may turn it out upon a hot dish. It then makes a
handsome show. It is safer to leave it in the baking-dish.
It must be served at once. It is very nice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Batter Pudding.</span> (<i>Very nice.</i>) <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk.</p>

<p>16 table-spoonfuls of flour.</p>

<p>4 eggs beaten very light.</p>

<p>Salt to taste.</p>

<p>Stir until the batter is free from lumps, and bake in
two buttered pie plates, or very shallow pudding-dishes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple and Batter Pudding.</span> (<i>Very good.</i>) <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 pint of milk.</p>

<p>2 eggs, beaten light.</p>

<p>1 dessert-spoonful butter, rubbed in the flour.</p>

<p>¼ teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in hot water.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful of cream of tartar, sifted in the flour.</p>

<p>A pinch of salt.</p>

<p>Flour enough for thin batter.</p>

<p>6 apples—well flavored and slightly tart.</p>

<p>Pare and core the apples and put them in a buttered
pudding-dish. Pour the batter over them and bake
three-quarters of an hour. Eat hot with hard sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pudding-dishes.</span></h3>

<p>The baking-dish of “ye olden time” was never
comely; often positively unsightly. Dainty housewives
pinned napkins around them and wreathed them
with flowers to make them less of an eyesore. In this
day, the pudding-maker can combine the æsthetic and
useful by using the enameled wares of <span class="smcap">Messrs.
Lalange and Grosjean, 89 Beekman Street, New
York</span>. The pudding-dishes made by them are pretty
in themselves, easily kept clean; do not crack or
blacken under heat, and are set on the table in handsome
stands of plated silver that completely conceal
the baking-dish. A silver rim runs around the top and
hides even the edge of the bowl. They can be had,
with or without covers, and are invaluable for macaroni,
scallops, and many other “baked meats.” Saucepans
and kettles of every kind are made in the same
ware by this firm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fritters.</span></h3>

<p>Not even so-called pastry is more ruthlessly murdered
in the mixing and baking than that class of
desserts the generic name of which stands at the head
of this bake. Heavy, sour, sticky and oleaginous
beyond civilized comparison, it is no marvel that the
compound popularly known and eaten as “fritter” has
become a doubtful dainty in the esteem of many, the
object of positive loathing to some.</p>

<p>I do not recommend my fritters to dyspeptics and
babies, nor as a standing dish to anybody. But that
they can be made toothsome, spongy and harmless, as
well as pleasant to those blessed with healthy appetites
and unimpaired digestions, I hold firmly and intelligently.</p>

<p>Two or three conditions are requisite to this end.
The fritters must be quickly made, thoroughly beaten,
of right consistency,—<i>and</i> they must not lie in the fat
the fraction of a minute after they are done. Take
them up with a perforated spoon, or egg-beater, and
lay on a hot sieve or cullender to drain before serving
on the dish that is to take them to the table. Moreover,
the fat must be hissing hot when the batter goes
in if you would not have them grease-soaked to the
very heart. Line the dish in which they are served
with tissue-paper fringed at the ends, or a clean napkin
to absorb any lingering drops of lard.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bell Fritters.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>2 cups of milk.</p>

<p>2 cups of prepared flour.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls sugar.</p>

<p>4 eggs, very well beaten.</p>

<p>A little salt.</p>

<p>½ tea-spoonful of cinnamon.</p>

<p>Beat the sugar into the yolks; add the milk, salt
and seasoning, the flour and whites alternately. Beat
hard for three minutes.</p>

<p>Have ready plenty of lard in a deep frying-pan or
Scotch kettle; make very hot; drop in the batter in
table-spoonfuls, and fry to a good brown. Be careful
not to scorch the lard, or the fritters will be ruined in
taste and color.</p>

<p>Throw upon a warm sieve or cullender as fast as
they are fried, and sift powdered sugar over them.</p>

<p>Eat hot with lemon sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rusk Fritters.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>12 stale rusks.</p>

<p>5 eggs.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls white sugar.</p>

<p>2 glasses best sherry.</p>

<p>Pare all the crust from the rusk, and cut each into
two pieces if small—into three if large. The slices
should be nearly an inch thick. Pour the wine over
them; leave them in it two or three minutes, then lay
on a sieve to drain. Beat the sugar into the yolks
(which should first be whipped and strained), then the
whites. Dip each slice into this mixture and fry in
boiling lard to a light golden brown.</p>

<p>Drain well; sprinkle with powdered sugar mingled
with cinnamon, and serve hot, with or without sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Light Fritters.</span></h3>

<p>3 cups stale bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>1 quart of milk.</p>

<p>4 eggs.</p>

<p>Salt and nutmeg to taste.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls prepared flour.</p>

<p>Scald the milk and pour it over the crumbs. Stir
to a smooth, soft batter, add the yolks, whipped and
strained, the seasoning, the flour—then, the whites
whisked very stiff. Mix well, and fry, by the table-spoonful,
in boiling lard. Drain; serve hot and eat
with sweet sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Currant Fritters.</span> (<i>Very nice.</i>)</h3>

<p>2 cups dry, fine bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls prepared flour.</p>

<p>2 cups of milk.</p>

<p>½ pound currants, washed and well dried.</p>

<p>5 eggs whipped very light, and the yolks strained.</p>

<p>½ cup powdered sugar.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful butter.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful mixed cinnamon and nutmeg.</p>

<p>Boil the milk and pour over the bread. Mix and
put in the butter. Let it get cold. Beat in, next, the
yolks and sugar, the seasoning, flour and stiff whites;
finally, the currants dredged whitely with flour. The
batter should be thick.</p>

<p>Drop in great spoonfuls into the hot lard and fry.
Drain them and send hot to table.</p>

<p>Eat with a mixture of wine and powdered sugar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon Fritters.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 heaping cups of prepared flour.</p>

<p>5 eggs—beaten stiff. Strain the yolks.</p>

<p>½ cup cream.</p>

<p>Grated peel of half a lemon.</p>

<p>½ cup powdered sugar.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful mingled nutmeg and cinnamon.</p>

<p>A little salt.</p>

<p>Beat up the whipped and strained yolks with the
sugar; add the seasoning and cream; the whites, at
last the flour, worked in quickly and lightly. It
should be a soft paste, just stiff enough to roll out.
Pass the rolling-pin once or twice over it until it is
about three-quarters of an inch thick. Cut into small,
circular cakes with a tumbler or cake-cutter; drop
into the hot lard and fry. They ought to puff up like
crullers. Drain on clean, hot paper. Eat warm with
a sauce made of—</p>

<p>Juice of 2 lemons.</p>

<p>Grated peel of one.</p>

<p>1 cup of powdered sugar.</p>

<p>1 glass wine.</p>

<p>Whites of 2 eggs beaten stiff.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Fritters.</span></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>8 or 10 fine pippins or greenings.</p>

<p>Juice of 1 lemon.</p>

<p>3 cups prepared flour.</p>

<p>6 eggs.</p>

<p>3 cups milk.</p>

<p>Some powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Cinnamon and nutmeg.</p>

<p>A little salt.</p>

<p>Pare and core the apples neatly, leaving a hole in
the centre of each. Cut crosswise into slices half an
inch thick. Spread these on a dish and sprinkle with
lemon-juice and powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Beat the eggs light, straining the yolks, and add to
the latter the milk and salt, the whites and the flour,
by turns. Dip the slices of apple into the batter,
turning them until they are thoroughly coated, and fry,
a few at a time, in hot lard. Throw upon a warm sieve
as fast as you take them out, and sift powdered sugar,
cinnamon and nutmeg over them.</p>

<p>These fritters require dexterous handling, but if
properly made and cooked, are delicious.</p>

<p>Eat with wine sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice Fritters.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 cups of milk.</p>

<p>Nearly a cup raw rice.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls sugar.</p>

<p>¼ pound raisins.</p>

<p>3 eggs.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful butter.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful flour.</p>

<p>Nutmeg and salt.</p>

<p>Soak the rice three hours in enough warm water to
cover it well. At the end of this time, put it into a
farina-kettle, set in an outer vessel of hot water, and
simmer until dry. Add the milk and cook until it is
all absorbed. Stir in the butter and take from the fire.
Beat the eggs very light with the sugar, and when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
rice has cooled, stir these in with the flour and seasoning.
Flour your hands well and make this into flat
cakes. Place in the middle of each two or three raisins
which have been “plumped” in boiling water. Roll
the cake into a ball enclosing the raisins, flour well and
fry in plenty of hot lard.</p>

<p>Serve on a napkin, with sugar and cinnamon sifted
over them. Eat with sweetened cream, hot or cold.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn-Meal Fritters.</span></h3>

<p>3 cups milk.</p>

<p>2 cups best Indian meal.</p>

<p>½ cup flour.</p>

<p>4 eggs.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful soda, dissolved in hot water.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful cream of tartar, sifted in flour.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful sugar.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful melted butter.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful salt.</p>

<p>Beat and strain the yolks; add sugar, butter, milk
and salt, the soda-water, and then stir in the Indian
meal. Beat five minutes <i>hard</i> before adding the
whites. The flour, containing the cream of tartar,
should go in last. Again, beat up vigorously. The
batter should be just thick enough to drop readily
from the spoon. Put into boiling lard by the spoonful.
One or two experiments as to the quantity to be
dropped for one fritter will teach you to regulate size
and shape.</p>

<p>Drain <i>very</i> well and serve at once. Eat with a sauce
made of butter and sugar, seasoned with cinnamon.</p>

<p>Some persons like a suspicion of ginger mixed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
fritters, or in the sauce. You can add or withhold it
as you please.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peach Fritters.</span> (<i>With Yeast.</i>)</h3>

<p>1 quart of flour.</p>

<p>1 cup of milk.</p>

<p>½ cup of yeast.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls sugar.</p>

<p>4 eggs.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls of butter.</p>

<p>A little salt.</p>

<p>Some fine, ripe freestone peaches, pared and stoned.</p>

<p>Sift the flour into a bowl; work in milk and yeast,
and set it in a tolerably warm place to rise. This will
take five or six hours. Then beat the eggs very light
with sugar, butter and salt. Mix this with the risen
dough, and beat with a stout wooden spoon until all
the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated. Knead
vigorously with your hands; pull off bits about the
size of an egg; flatten each and put in the centre a
peach, from which the stone has been taken through a
slit in the side. Close the dough upon it, make into a
round roll and set in order upon a floured pan for the
second rising. The balls must not touch one another.
They should be light in an hour. Have ready a large
round-bottomed Scotch kettle or saucepan, with plenty
of lard—boiling hot. Drop in your peach-pellets and
fry more slowly than you would fritters made in the
usual way. Drain on hot white paper; sift powdered
sugar over them and eat hot with brandy sauce.</p>

<p>You can make these of canned peaches or apricots
wiped dry from the syrup.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Fritters.</span></h3>

<p>6 table-spoonfuls mashed potato—very fine.</p>

<p>½ cup good cream.</p>

<p>5 eggs—the yolks light and strained—the whites whisked very stiff.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls powdered sugar.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls prepared flour.</p>

<p>Juice of 1 lemon. Half the grated peel.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful nutmeg.</p>

<p>Work the cream into the potato; beat up light and
rub through a sieve, or very fine cullender. Add to
this the beaten yolks and sugar. Whip to a creamy
froth; put in the lemon, flour, nutmeg, and beat five
minutes longer before the whites are stirred in. Have
your lard ready and hot in the frying-pan. Drop in
the batter by the spoonful and fry to a light brown.
Drain on clean paper, and serve at once.</p>

<p>Eat with wine sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Fritters.</span> (<i>Very nice.</i>)</h3>

<p>1 cup cream.</p>

<p>5 eggs—the whites only.</p>

<p>2 full cups prepared flour.</p>

<p>1 saltspoonful nutmeg.</p>

<p>A pinch of salt.</p>

<p>Stir the whites into the cream in turn with the flour,
put in nutmeg and salt, beat all up hard for two
minutes. The batter should be rather thick. Fry in
plenty of hot sweet lard, a spoonful of batter for each
fritter. Drain and serve upon a hot, clean napkin.</p>

<p>Eat with jelly sauce. Pull, not cut them open.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roll Fritters, or Imitation Doughnuts.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>8 small round rolls, stale and light.</p>

<p>1 cup rich milk.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls sugar.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful mixed nutmeg and cinnamon.</p>

<p>Beaten yolks of 3 eggs.</p>

<p>1 cupful powdered crackers.</p>

<p>Pare every bit of the crust from the rolls with a keen
knife, and trim them into round balls. Sweeten the
milk with the sugar, put in the spice; lay the rolls upon
a soup-plate, and pour the milk over them. Turn
them over and over, until they soak it all up. Drain
for a few minutes on a sieve; dip in the beaten yolks,
roll in the powdered cracker, and fry in plenty of lard.</p>

<p>Drain and serve hot with lemon-sauce.</p>

<p>They are very good.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sponge-Cake Fritters.</span></h3>

<p>6 or 8 square (penny) sponge-cakes.</p>

<p>1 cup cream, boiling hot, with a pinch of soda stirred in.</p>

<p>4 eggs, whipped light.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful corn-starch, wet up in cold milk.</p>

<p>¼ pound currants, washed and dried.</p>

<p>Pound the cakes fine, and pour the cream over them.
Stir in the corn-starch. Cover for half an hour, then
beat until cold. Add the yolks—light and strained,
the whipped whites, then the currants thickly dredged
with flour. Beat all hard together. Drop in spoonfuls
into the boiling lard; fry quickly; drain upon a
warmed sieve, and send to table hot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>The syrup of brandied fruit makes an excellent
sauce for these.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Curd Fritters.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart sweet milk.</p>

<p>2 glasses white wine.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful liquid rennet.</p>

<p>5 eggs, whipped light.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls prepared flour.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Nutmeg to taste.</p>

<p>Scald the milk, and pour in the wine and rennet.
Take from the fire, cover, and let it stand until curd
and whey are well separated. Drain off every drop of
the latter, and dry the curd by laying for a few
minutes upon a soft, clean cloth. Beat yolks and sugar
together, whip in the curd until fully mixed; then the
flour, nutmeg and whites. The batter should be
smooth, and rather thick.</p>

<p>Have ready some butter in a small frying-pan; drop
in the fritters a few at a time, and fry quickly. Drain
upon a warm sieve, lay within a dish lined with white
paper, or a clean napkin; sift powdered sugar over
them, and eat with jelly sauce.</p>

<p>Odd as the receipt may seem in the reading, the
fritters are most palatable. In the country, where milk
is plenty, they may be made of cream—unless, as is
too often the case, the good wife <i>will</i> save all the cream
for butter.</p>

<h2>CONCERNING ALLOWANCES.<br />

<small>(<span class="smcap">Confidential—with John.</span>)</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I do</span> not like that word “allowance.” It savors too
much of a stipend granted by a lordling to a serf; a
government pension to a beneficiary; the dole of the
rich to the poor. But since it has crept into general
use as descriptive of that portion of the wife’s earnings
which she is permitted to disburse more or less at
her discretion, we must take it as we find it.</p>

<p>Marriage is to a woman one of two things—licensed,
and therefore honorable beggary, or, a copartnership
with her husband upon fair and distinctly specified
terms. When I spoke of the wife’s earnings just now,
it was not with reference to moneys accumulated by
work or investments outside of the home which she
occupies with you and your children. We will set
aside, if you please, the legal and religious fiction that
you have endowed her with all—or half your worldly
goods, and put still further from our consideration the
sounding oaths with which you protested in the days of
your wooing, that you cared nothing for pelf and lucre—Cupid’s
terms for stocks, bonds and mortgages, houses
and lands—except that you might cast them at her feet.
If you recollect such figures of speech at all, it is with
a laugh, good-humored, or shame-faced, and the plea
that everybody talks in the same way in like circumstances;
that pledges thus given are in no wise to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
regarded as promissory notes. Hymen’s is a general
court of bankruptcy so far as such obligations go.
Your wife is a sensible woman, and never expected to
take you at your word—at least, such hot and hasty
words as those, in which you declared yourself to be
the most abject of her slaves, and herself the empress
of your universe, including the aforementioned stocks,
mortgages, houses and lands, real and personal estate—all
assets <i>in esse</i> and <i>in posse</i>.</p>

<p>Having cleared away, by a stroke of common sense,
this gossamer, that like other cobwebs, is pretty while
the dew of early morning impearls it, and only an annoyance
afterward; particularly odious when it entangles
itself about the lips and eyes of him who lately
admired it—we will look at the question of the wife’s
work and wages from a business point of view—pencil
and paper in hand.</p>

<p>First, we will determine what should be the salary
of a competent housekeeper; one who makes her employer’s
interests her own; who rises up early and lies
down late, and eats the bread of carefulness; who is
not to be coaxed away by higher wages, and is never in
danger of giving warning if her “feelings are hurt;”
if the servants are insubordinate, or the master is given
to fault-finding, and not always respectful to herself.
It would be to your interest, were you a widower, you
confess, to give this treasure two dollars a day—as
women’s wages go. “And,” you add in a burst of
manly confidence, “she would be cheap at that.” But
we will put down her salary in round numbers, at $700
per annum.</p>

<p>Now comes the seamstress’ pay. Again, a “competent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
person,” one who is ever in her place; whose
work-hours number fourteen out of the twenty-four, if
her services are required by you or the children;
whose needle is always threaded, her eye ever vigilant;
with whom slighting and botching are things unknown
by practice; who takes pride in seeing each of the
household trig and tidy; who “seeketh wool and flax,
and worketh willingly with her hands;” who is an adept
in fine needlework as in plain sewing, and not a novice
in dress-making; who, perchance, can “manage” boys’
clothes as well as girls—who will do it, of a certainty,
if you explain that you cannot afford tailors’ bills for
urchins under ten years of age; finally, who possesses
that most valuable of arts for a poor man’s wife,</p>

<div class="center">
“To gar auld claes look a’maist as weel as new.”<br />
</div>

<p>Shall we allow to this nonpareil the wages of an ordinary
seamstress who “cannot undertake cutting and
fitting,”—one dollar a day? Or, is she entitled to the
pay of a dressmaker’s assistant—half a dollar more? I
do not want to be hard with you. We will set her down
for $450 a year. And, again, we conclude that you
have made a good bargain.</p>

<p>Next, the nursery-governess, and perhaps the most
important functionary in the household. She must,
you stipulate, have charge of the children, by day and
night; guard morals, health and manners, besides
teaching the youngerlings the rudiments of reading
and writing; must superintend the preparation of the
elder ones’ lessons for school-recitations, and look to it
that catechism and Bible-lesson are ready for Sabbath-school;
that musical exercises are duly practised; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
home is made so attractive to the boys that they shall
not be drawn thence by the questionable hilarity of
engine-house and oyster-cellar. A lady she must be,
else how would your girls be trained to modest and
graceful behavior, and your friends be entertained as
you deem is due to you and to them, in your house?
A responsible, judicious person is indispensable to the
comfort and health of you and yours; one who does
not regard the care of a young baby as “too confining;”
nor sleepless nights on account of it, a valid
reason for “bettering herself;” nor a brisk succession
of measles, mumps and chicken-pox cogent cause for
informing you that she “didn’t engage for this sort of
work, and would you be suiting yourself with a lady
as has a stronger constitution—immediate, for her
trunk is packed.”</p>

<p>Would a thousand dollars per annum provide you
with such a hireling? I knew a wealthy man who offered
just that sum for a nursery-governess during the
protracted illness of his wife. She must be intelligent
and ladylike, he stated, qualified to undertake the education
of the three younger children. There were six
in all, but there was a tutor for the boys. The governess’
bed-room adjoined that of the little girls, the
door of which must stand open all night. The baby’s
crib was to be by her bed, and a child, three years old,
was also to share her chamber. She would be treated
respectfully and kindly, and every enjoyment of the
luxurious establishment, compatible with the proper
discharge of the duties appointed, would be hers.</p>

<p><i>He could get no one to take the place.</i></p>

<p>This is simple fact, and it is pregnant with meaning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, what if we put down the wages of
your nursery-governess at the same sum you are willing
to give your housekeeper—$700? Oblige me by
adding up the short row of figures under your hand.</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="household figures">
<tr><td align="right">$700</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">450</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right"><span class="u">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;700</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">$1,850</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>This you will please consider as the amount of your
wife’s salary, due from you for services rendered, exclusive
of board and lodgings, which are always the
portion of resident employees in your house. There
is no charge for “extras,” you observe. We have said
nothing about the bill for nursing you through that
four weeks’ spell of inflammatory rheumatism last
winter, or the longer siege of fever, three years ago,
when this servant-of-all-work sat up with you fourteen
weary nights, and would entrust the care of you to no
one else. By her skillful ministrations, the miracle of
her patience, love and prayers, you were rescued, say
the doctors, from the close clutch of death. You cannot
see the figures very distinctly while you think of
it, but we agreed, at the outset, to keep feeling in the
background.</p>

<p>You “have tried to be a kind, affectionate husband,”
you say, in a very unbusiness-like way.</p>

<p>I believe you, and so does the blessed little woman
whom I have shut out from this conference, lest her
foolish fondness should spoil the effect of our matter-of-fact
talk. I would have you and all husbands b<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>e
<i>just</i>, no less than loving. Let us return to our figures.
The estimate is for a man of moderate means and
modest home, one of the middle class which is everywhere
the bone and muscle of the community—the
class that makes national character, the world over.
If you are wealthy, and put the care of a large and
elegant establishment upon your manager, the remuneration
should be in proportion. For a fancy article
you have to pay a fancy price. You misunderstand
your wife and me, if you imagine that we would inaugurate
in your household a debit and credit system
and quarter-day settlements. She would be the first
to shrink from such an interpretation of your mutual
relations. I should, of all your friends and well-wishers,
be the last to recommend it.</p>

<p>But I have studied this matter long and seriously,
and I offer you as the result of my observation in various
walks of life, and careful calculation of labor
and expense, the bold assertion that every wife who
performs her part, even tolerably well, in whatever
rank of society, more than earns her living, and that
this should be an acknowledged fact with both parties
to the marriage contract. The idea of her dependence
upon her husband is essentially false and mischievous,
and should be done away with, at once and forever.
It has crushed self-respect out of thousands of women;
it has scourged thousands from the marriage-altar to
the tomb, with a whip of scorpions; it has driven
many to desperation and crime.</p>

<p>“Every dollar is a lash!” I once overheard a wife
say, in bitter soliloquy, as her husband left her presence
after placing in her hand the money for which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
she had timidly asked him, to pay the weekly household
bills.</p>

<p>Then, still supposing herself unseen, she threw the
roll of bank-notes upon the floor and trampled it
under foot, in a transport of impotent, and, to my way
of thinking, righteous wrath.</p>

<p>“An exceptional case?” I beg your pardon! I
wish it were. Her husband meant to be kind and affectionate
as honestly as do you. When money was
“easy,” he would give it to her freely and cheerfully,
provided his mood was propitious at the time of her
application. He had expended large sums in the purchase
of jewelry and handsome clothing for her, and
exulted in seeing her arrayed in them. He loved her
truly, and was proud of her. His mistake was in ignoring
the fact that he <i>owed</i> her anything in actual
dollars and cents; that she worked for her livelihood
as faithfully as did he, and that his debt to her was, in
the highest degree, a “confidential” one. If put into
the confessional, he would have admitted that he
thought of himself as the only bread-winner of the
family, and was, sometimes, tartly intolerant of the
domestic demands upon his earnings. He made a yet
grosser mistake in feeling and behaving as if the
money deposited in her hands for the current expenses
of the establishment, were a gift to her personally.
This is a masculine blunder that poisons the happiness
of more women than I like to think of, or you would
be willing to believe. Be kindly-affectioned as you
will, your wife cannot respect you thoroughly if she
sees that you are habitually unreasonable and unjust.
And it is neither just nor rational to speak and act as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
if all the butter, flour, sugar, meat and sundries which
she saves you the trouble of buying, and of which,
nine times out of ten, she is the more judicious purchaser,
were to be consumed by her, and her alone.</p>

<p>“You never thought of such a thing!” you protest
betwixt laughter and vexation.</p>

<p>Then, do not act as if it were your settled conviction.</p>

<p>Set aside from your income what you adjudge to be
a reasonable and liberal sum for the maintenance of
your family in the style suitable for people of your
means and position. Determine what purchases you
will yourself make, and what shall be intrusted to
your wife, and put the money needed for her proportion
into her care as frankly as you take charge of
your share. Try the experiment of talking to her as
if she were a business partner. Let her understand
what you can afford to do, and what you cannot. If
in this explanation you can say, “we,” and “ours,”
you will gain a decided moral advantage, although it
may be at the cost of masculine prejudice and pride
of power. Impress upon her mind that a certain sum,
made over to her apart from the rest, is hers absolutely.
Not a present from you, but her honest earnings, and
that <i>you</i> would not be honest were you to withhold it.
And do not ask her “if that will do?” any more than
you would address the question to any other workwoman.
(With what cordial detestation wives regard
that brief query, which drops, like a sentence of the
creed, from husbandly lips, I leave your spouse to tell
you. Also, if she ever heard of a woman who answered
anything but “yes.”)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>Advise her, for her own satisfaction, and because it is
“business like,” to keep an account of her receipts and
expenditures, but apprise her distinctly that you do
not expect her to exhibit this to you, unless she should
need your assistance or advice in balancing her books,
or in some perplexed question of “profit and loss.”
She will be ready to appreciate that the one sum deposited
with her is a trust fund to be used to the best
advantage for the general good, and the proud consciousness
that she is the actual proprietor of the other,
and irresponsible, save to her conscience, for the manner
in which it is spent, will make her the more careful
not to use it amiss. As to the housekeeping money—the
weekly or monthly “allowance”—you may be
very sure that you and the children will get the benefit
of every cent. However economically she may handle
her private store, the bulk of it will not be increased by
surreptitious pinchings from the family supply of daily
bread.</p>

<p>I have known women whose sole perquisites were
what they could save from their not large allowances,
who, in the absence of their husbands from home,
would keep themselves and families of hungry, growing
children,—with the consent and co-operation of the
latter—upon the most meagre fare consistent with the
bare satisfaction of the cravings of nature, that the
few dollars thus spared might go toward the purchase
of some coveted article of dress for one of the girls;
a set of tools or books for a boy, or a piece of furniture
desired by all. Which bit of economy (!) being
reported to the <i>paterfamilias</i> when the dearly-bought
thing was exhibited, was pronounced by him, his hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
complacently finding its way to the plethoric wallet in
his pocket, to be worthy of his august approval. How
many husbands have heard their wives remark how
cheaply the family lived when “papa was away?” and
how many have asked themselves seriously why and
how this was done?</p>

<p>Other women, and more to be pitied, I am acquainted
with, who make false entries in the account-books,
which are showed weekly to their lords as explanatory
of “the way the money goes.” It is easier
and less likely “to make a fuss,” to record that seven
pounds of butter have been bought and used, his lordship
having helped in the consumption thereof, when
by sharp management, five have sufficed; to write
down “new shoes for Bobby, $4,00,” when, in reality,
the cost of mending his old ones that they might last a
month longer, was only $1,50,—than to confess to the
practical critic who does not overlook a single item,
that the money “made” by these expedients was
spent, partly in paying up a yearly subscription to the
Charitable Society; partly for an innocent luncheon
during a day’s shopping in the city.</p>

<p>“Unjustifiable deception?” Have I pretended to
excuse it? But I look back of the timid woman—the
pauper, bedecked in silks, laces and gems,—for most
men like to see their wives dressed as well as their
neighbors—the moral coward, who has lied from the
natural desire to handle a little money for herself
without being cross-examined about it—and ask—“by
what stress of humiliating tyranny was she brought to
this?”</p>

<p>All women do not manage monetary affairs well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
you remind me, gently. Some are unprincipled in
their extravagance, reckless of everything save their
own whims and unconscionable desires. Must a man
beggar himself and those dependent upon him, lest
such an one should accuse him of parsimony? By
yielding to demands he knows to be exorbitant, he
proves himself to be weaker even than she.</p>

<p>I have said nowhere that a woman is the best judge
of what her husband ought to appropriate from his
gains or fortune for the support of his family. But
he stands convicted of a grave error of judgment, if he
has chosen from the whole world as the keeper of his
honor and happiness, a woman whom he cannot trust to
touch his purse-strings.</p>

<p>Let us be patient as well as reasonable. So long as a
babe is kept in long clothes, and carried in arms, it will
not learn to walk alone. The majority of women have
been swathed in conventionalities and borne above the
practicalities of business by mistaken tenderness or misapprehension
of their powers, for so long, that, however
quick may be their intuitions, time and practice
are necessary to make them adepts in financiering. The
best way to render them trustworthy is not by taking
it for granted, and letting them see that you do, that
they have sinister designs upon your pockets. They are
not pirates by nature, nor are they, even with such
schooling as many get from their legal proprietors,
always on the alert to wheedle or extort a few dollars for
their own sty and selfish ends. After all, is there not a
spice of truth in the would-be satire of the old distich?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“What are wives made of—made of?</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Everything good, <i>if they’re but understood!</i>”</span></div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>If you chance to be painfully conscious of the mental
inferiority and warped conscience of your partner
in the solemn dance of life; if there is more “worse”
than “better” in the everyday wear of the matrimonial
bond; if sloth and waste mark her administration
of household affairs, instead of the industrious thrift
you would recommend, and which you see others practise;
if the rent in the bottom of the pouch carries off
the money faster than you can drop it in, you are to
be pitied almost as much as your bachelor neighbor,
who sews on his own buttons, and depends upon boarding-houses
for his daily food. Still, my friend, is
there any reason why you should accept the consequences
of this one mistake on your part, with less
philosophy; bring to the bearing of it a smaller modicum
of Christian resignation than you summon to support
you under any other? Women have been as
grievously misled by fancy or affection, before now,
and have borne the burden of disappointment to the
grave without murmur or reproach.</p>

<p>Then, there is always the chance that your wife is
not “understood,” or that, well-meant as your attempts
to “manage” her have been, you have not selected
the most judicious methods of doing this. In this enlightened
and liberal age, nobody, unless he be bigot
or fool, habitually thinks and speaks of women as a
lower order of intelligent beings. But even in your
breast, my ill-mated friend, there may lurk a touch of
the ancient leaven of uncharitableness, and in your
treatment of her “whom the Lord hath given to be with
you,” there may be a spice of arrogance, the exponent of
which, were you Turk or Kaffir, would be brute force.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>“I do not object to your proposal, my love. You
always have your own way in household affairs,” said
a very “kind and affectionate” man to his wife, with
the air of a potentate amiably relinquishing his sceptre
for love’s sake.</p>

<p>“Will you tell me, my dear husband, why, if I
conduct ‘household affairs’ wisely and pleasantly (and
you have often acknowledged that I do!) I should
not have my own way?” was the unexpected reply,
uttered in perfect temper—no less sweetly for being an
argument. “For twenty years I have made domestic
economy a constant and practical study. Is it reasonable
to suppose that, after all this expenditure of time
and thought, I am not a better judge of ways and
means in my profession than are you, whose life has
been spent in other pursuits? For all your indulgent
affection to me, as displayed in a thousand ways since
our marriage-day, I love and thank you. But excuse me
for saying that I am not grateful that you have, as you
are rather fond of saying, ‘made it a point to give me
my head’ in all pertaining to housekeeping. That
you do this shows that you are just and honorable. It
is no more a <i>favor</i> done to me than is my non-interference
with your clerks and purchases, your shipments
and warehouses, a matter for which you should thank
me.”</p>

<p>The husband stroked his beard thoughtfully. He
was a sensible man, and magnanimous enough to recognize
the truth that his wife was a sensible woman.</p>

<p>“Upon my word,” he said, presently, with a frank
laugh, “that is a view of the case I never took before.
I believe you are right.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>One more hint, which may be of service to those who
are not so ready to acknowledge the superiority—in
any case—of feminine reasoning, or to such as are
<i>not</i> blessed with sensible consorts—the best friends of
these ladies being judges.</p>

<p>“Drive him with an easy rein!” said my John in
trusting me for the first time to manage his favorite
horse. “His mouth is tender as a woman’s. You cannot
deal with a thoroughbred as with a cold-blooded
roadster.”</p>

<p>“What will happen if I hold him in hard?” inquired
I, eyeing the pointed ears and arched neck
with as much apprehension as admiration.</p>

<p>I commend the laconic answer to your consideration,
as altogether pertinent to the subject we have been
discussing.</p>

<p>“A rear-up, and a run backward, instead of forward!”</p>

<h2>RIPE FRUIT.<br />
————————<br /></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sight of the fruit-dish or basket upon the breakfast
table has become so common of late years that
its absence, rather than its presence, in the season of
ripe fruits would be remarked, and felt even painfully
by some. It is fashionable, and therefore considered a
wise sanitary measure, to eat oranges as a prelude to
the regular business of the morning meal. Grapes are
eaten so long as they can be conveniently obtained. It
may be because my own taste and digestion revolt at
the practice of forcing crude acids upon an empty, and
often faint stomach, that I am disposed to doubt the
healthfulness of the innovation upon the long-established
rule that sets fruit always in the place of dessert.
I have an actual antipathy to the pungent odor of raw
orange-peel, and have been driven from the breakfast-table
at a hotel more than once by the overpowering
effect of the piles of yellow rind at my left, right, and
opposite to me. A cluster of grapes taken before
breakfast would put me, and others whom I know,
<i>hors de combat</i> for the day with severe headache. In
the consciousness of this, I can be courageous in declining
the “first course” of an <i>à la mode</i> breakfast,
and at my own table, withholding the fruit until the
stomach has regained its normal tone under the judicious
application of substantial viands. Then, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
pleasant to linger over the vinous globes of crimson,
purple, and pale-green; to dip ripe strawberries in
powdered sugar with lazy gusto; to pare rosy rareripes
and golden Bartletts while discussing the day’s news
and plans, in the serene belief that the healthful, delicious
juices are assimilating whatever incongruous
elements have preceded them in the alimentary canal.</p>

<p>I write this, not to guide the practice of other households,
but to enforce a remark I see an opportunity for
bringing in here. Be a slavish follower of no custom
whatsoever. It is sensible and expedient to act in
uniformity with your neighbors when you can do so
without moral or physical injury. Conformity to a
foolish or hurtful fashion is always weak, if not positively
wicked.</p>

<p>Serve your fruit, then, as the first or last course at
your family breakfast as may seem right to yourself,
but, by all means, have it whenever you can procure it
comfortably and without much expense. In warm
weather, you had better banish meat from the morning
bill of fare, three days in the week, than have the
children go without berries and other fresh fruits.
Make a pretty glass dish, or silver or wicker basket of
peaches, pears or plums, an institution of the summer
breakfast. In autumn, you can have grapes until after
frost; then, oranges and bananas if you desire. These,
being expensive luxuries, are not absolutely enjoined
by nature or common sense. Let the “basket of summer
fruit,” however, be a comely and agreeable reality
while solstitial suns beget bile, and miasma walks, a
living, almost visible presence, through the land.</p>

<p>Fruits, each in its season, are the cheapest, most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
elegant and wholesome dessert you can offer your
family or friends, at luncheon or tea. Pastry and
plum-pudding should be prohibited by law, from the
beginning of June until the end of September. And
in winter, a dish of apples and oranges flanked by one
of boiled chestnuts, and another of picked walnut or
hickory-nut kernels, will often please John and the
bairns better than the rich dessert that cost you a hot
hour over the kitchen-range, when Bridget was called
away to a cousin’s funeral, or Daphne was laid up
with “a misery in her head.”</p>

<p>Among the creams, jellies and “forms” of a state-dinner
dessert, fruit is indispensable, and the arrangement
and preparation of the choicer varieties is a matter
for the taste and skill of the mistress, or her refined
daughters, as are the floral decorations of the feast.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Frosted Peaches.</span></h3>

<p>12 large rich peaches—freestones.</p>

<p>Whites of three eggs, whisked to a standing froth.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls water.</p>

<p>1 cup powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Put water and beaten whites together; dip in each
peach when you have rubbed off the fur with a clean
cloth, and then roll in powdered sugar. Set up carefully,
on the stem end, upon a sheet of white paper,
laid on a waiter in a sunny window. When half dry,
roll again in the sugar. Expose to the sun and breeze
until perfectly dry, then, put in a cool, dry place until
you are ready to arrange them in the glass dish for
table.</p>

<p>Garnish with green leaves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

</table></div>

<p>Pare the oranges, squeezing them as little as you can,
remove every particle of the inner white skin, and
divide them into lobes, taking care not to break the
skin. Take half of the sugar meant for frosting, and
stir it up with a few drops of liquid cochineal. Spread
on a dish in the sun to dry, and if it lump, roll or
pound again to powder. Put the white sugar in
another dish. Add the water to the stiffened whites;
dip in one-third of the orange lobes and roll in the
white sugar; another third, first in the eggs and water,
then in the red sugar. Lay them upon a sheet of
paper to dry.</p>

<p>Put the gum arabic and hot water together over the
fire, and when the gum is melted, add the cup of sugar.
Stir until it is a clear, thick glue. Set in a pan of hot
water and dip the remaining pieces of orange in it.
Lay a stick lengthwise on a flat dish, and lean the lobes
against it on both sides, to dry.</p>

<p>Heap red, white, and yellow together in a glass dish,
and garnish with leaves—orange or lemon leaves if you
can get them.</p>

<p>This is a delicate, but not difficult, bit of work, and
the effect is very pretty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tropical Snow.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>10 sweet oranges.</p>

<p>1 grated cocoanut.</p>

<p>2 glasses pale sherry.</p>

<p>1 cup powdered sugar.</p>

<p>6 red bananas.</p>

<p>Peel the oranges; divide into lobes and cut these
across three times, making small pieces, from which the
seeds must be taken. Put a layer of these in the
bottom of a glass bowl, and pour a little wine over
them. Strew thickly with white sugar. The cocoanut
should have been pared and thrown into cold water
before it was grated. Spread some of it over the
sugared oranges; cut the bananas into very thin round
slices, and put a layer of the fruit close together, all
over the cocoanut. More oranges, wine, sugar and
cocoanut, and when the dish is full, heap high with the
cocoanut. Sprinkle sugar on this, and ornament with
rings of sliced banana. Eat very soon, or the oranges
will grow tough in the wine.</p>

<p>Oranges cut up in the way I have described are
more easily managed with a spoon, and less juice is
wasted, than when they are sliced in the usual manner.</p>

<p>This is a handsome and delightful dessert.</p>

pounded to a paste, with a little rose-water. Boil three
minutes, and pour gradually upon the beaten eggs,
stirring all the time. Return to the fire and boil until
well thickened. When cold turn into a glass bowl, and
heap high with the grated cocoanut. Sift a little
powdered sugar over all.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Apples.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Core the fruit without paring it, and put it into a
glass or stoneware jar, with a cover. Set in a pot
of cold water and bring to a slow boil. Leave it at
the back of the range for seven or eight hours, boiling
gently all the time. Let the apples get perfectly cold
before you open the jar.</p>

<p>Eat with plenty of sugar and cream.</p>

<p>Only sweet apples are good cooked in this manner,
and they are very good.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Pears.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Cut ripe pears in half, without peeling or removing
the stems. Pack in layers in a stoneware or glass jar.
Strew a little sugar over each layer. Put a small cupful
of water in the bottom of the jar to prevent burning;
fit on a close cover, and set in a moderate oven.
Bake three hours, and let the jar stand unopened in
the oven all night.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apples and Jelly.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Fill a baking-dish with pippins, or other tender juicy
apples, pared and cored, but not sliced. Make a syrup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
of one cup of water, and half as much sugar; stir
until the sugar is dissolved, and pour over the apples.
Cover closely, and bake slowly until tender. Draw
from the oven, and let the apples cool without uncovering.
Pour off the syrup, and fill the hollowed centres
with some bright fruit jelly.</p>

<p>Boil down the syrup fast, until quite thick, and, just
before sending the apples to table, stir into it some rich
cream sweetened very abundantly. Pass with the
apples.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Chestnuts.</span></h3>

<p>Put into warm (not hot) water, slightly salted, bring
to a boil, and cook fast fifteen minutes. Turn off the
water through a cullender; stir a good piece of butter
into the hot chestnuts, tossing them over and over until
they are glossy and dry.</p>

<p>Serve upon a hot napkin in a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Walnuts and Hickory Nuts.</span></h3>

<p>Crack and pick from the shells; sprinkle salt lightly
over them, and serve mixed in the same dish.</p>

<p>Black walnuts are much more wholesome when eaten
with salt. Indeed, they are not wholesome at all without
it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Melons.</span></h3>

<p>Wipe watermelons clean when they are taken from
the ice. They should lie on, or in ice, for at least four
hours before they are eaten. Carve at table by slicing
off each end, then cutting the middle in sharp, long
points, letting the knife go half way through the melon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
at every stroke. Pull the halves apart, and you will
have a dentated crown.</p>

<p>Wash nutmeg and muskmelons; wipe dry; cut in
two, scrape out the seeds, and put a lump of ice in
each half.</p>

<p>Eat with sugar, or with mixed pepper and salt.</p>

<h2>CAKES OF ALL KINDS.</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nellie’s Cup Cake.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>5 cups of flour.</p>

<p>5 eggs, whites and yolks separated—the latter strained.</p>

<p>1 cup of butter, }</p>

<p>3 cups of sugar, } well creamed together.</p>

<p>1 cup of sweet milk.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful soda, dissolved in hot water.</p>

<p>2 teaspoonfuls of cream tartar, sifted with flour.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful of vanilla.</p>

<p>If prepared flour be used in this or any other cake,
there is no need of soda and cream of tartar.</p>

<p>Hecker’s flour I have found invaluable in cake-making.
Indeed, I have never achieved anything short
of triumphant success when I have used it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Carolina Cake (without Eggs.)</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 cup of butter, }</p>

<p>2 cups of sugar, } rubbed to a light cream.</p>

<p>1 cup of sweet milk.</p>

<p>6 eggs, the whites only—beaten stiff.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in boiling water.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful of cream tartar, sifted with flour.</p>

<p>4 cups of flour, or enough for tolerably thick batter.</p>

<p>Juice of 1 lemon, and half the grated peel.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Cake.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 cups of sugar.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls butter, rubbed in with the sugar.</p>

<p>4 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately.</p>

<p>1 cup sweet milk.</p>

<p>3 heaping cups of flour.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful of cream tartar, sifted into flour.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful soda, melted in hot water.</p>

<p>Bake in jelly cake tins.</p>

<h4><i>Filling.</i></h4>

<p>Whites of two eggs, beaten to a froth.</p>

<p>1 cup of powdered sugar.</p>

<p>¼ pound grated chocolate, wet in 1 table-spoonful cream.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful vanilla.</p>

<p>Beat the sugar into the whipped whites; then the
chocolate. Whisk all together hard for three minutes
before adding the vanilla. Let the cake get quite cold
before you spread it. Reserve a little of the mixture
for the top, and beat more sugar into this to form a
firm icing.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Cake.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>2 cups powdered sugar.</p>

<p>3 cups of flour.</p>

<p>½ cup corn-starch, wet up with a little milk.</p>

<p>½ cup of butter, rubbed to light cream with sugar.</p>

<p>½ cup sweet milk.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful cream of tartar, sifted with flour.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful soda, dissolved in hot water.</p>

<p>6 eggs, the whites only, whipped very stiff.</p>

<p>Add the milk to the creamed butter and sugar; the
soda-water, corn-starch, then the flour and whites
alternately. Bake in jelly cake tins.</p>

<h4><i>Filling.</i></h4>

<p>3 tart, well-flavored apples, grated.</p>

<p>1 egg, beaten light.</p>

<p>1 cup of sugar.</p>

<p>1 lemon, grated peel and juice.</p>

<p>Beat sugar and egg up with the lemon. Pare the
apples and grate them directly into this mixture, letting
an assistant stir it the while. The color will be better
preserved by this method. Put into a farina-kettle,
with boiling water in the outer vessel, and stir until it
comes to a boil. Let it cool before putting it between
the cakes.</p>

<p>It is best eaten fresh.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Orange Cake.</span></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls butter.</p>

<p>2 cups of sugar.</p>

<p>Yolks of 5 eggs, whites of three, beaten separately—the yolks strained through a sieve after they are whipped.</p>

<p>1 cup of cold water.</p>

<p>3 full cups of flour—enough for good batter.</p>

<p>1 large orange, the juice, and half the grated peel.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful soda, dissolved in hot water.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful cream of tartar, sifted in flour.</p>

<p>Cream the butter and sugar; add the eggs; heat in
the orange, the water, soda, and stir in the flour quickly.</p>

<p>Bake in jelly cake tins.</p>

<h4><i>Filling.</i></h4>

<p>Whites of two eggs, whisked stiff.</p>

<p>1 cup powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Juice, and half the peel of an orange.</p>

<p>Whip very light, and spread between the cakes when
cold.</p>

<p>Reserve a little, and whip more sugar into it for
frosting on top layer.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Charlotte Polonaise Cake.</span> (<i>Very fine.</i>) <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 cups powdered sugar.</p>

<p>½ cup of butter.</p>

<p>4 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately.</p>

<p>1 small cup of cream, or rich milk.</p>

<p>3 cups of prepared flour.</p>

<p>Bake as for jelly cake.</p>

<h4><i>Filling.</i></h4>

<p>6 eggs, whipped very light.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls flour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>3 cups of cream—scalding hot.</p>

<p>6 table-spoonfuls grated chocolate.</p>

<p>6 table-spoonfuls powdered sugar.</p>

<p>½ pound sweet almonds, blanched and pounded.</p>

<p>¼ pound chopped citron.</p>

<p>¼ pound apricots, peaches, or other crystallized fruit.</p>

<p>½ pound macaroons.</p>

<p>Beat the yolks of the eggs very light. Stir into the
cream the flour which has been previously wet with a
little cold milk.</p>

<p>Add very carefully the beaten yolks, and keep the
mixture at a slow boil, stirring all the time, for five
minutes. Take from the fire and divide the custard
into three equal portions. Put the grated chocolate,
with the macaroons, finely crumbled (or pounded),
with one table-spoonful of sugar, into one pan of the
mixture, stirring and beating well. Boil five minutes,
stirring constantly; take from the fire, whip with your
egg-beater five minutes more, and set aside to cool.</p>

<p>Pound the blanched almonds—a few at a time—in a
Wedgewood mortar, adding, now and then, a few drops
of rose-water. Chop the citron very fine and mix with
the almonds, adding three table-spoonfuls of sugar.
Stir into the second portion of custard; heat to a slow
boil; take it off and set by to cool.</p>

<p>Chop the crystallized fruit very small, and put with
the third cupful of custard. Heat to a boil; pour out
and let it cool.</p>

<p>Season the chocolate custard with vanilla; the almond
and citron with bitter almond. The fruit will
require no other flavoring. When quite cold, lay out
four cakes made according to receipt given here, or
bake at the same time a white cake in jelly-cake tins, and
alternate with that. This will give you two good loaves.
Put the chocolate filling between the first and second
cakes; next, the almond and citron; the fruit custard
next to the top. There will be enough for both loaves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>Ice the tops with lemon icing, made of the whites
of the eggs whisked very stiff with powdered sugar, and
flavored with lemon-juice.</p>

<p>Lest the reader should, at a casual glance through
this receipt, be appalled at the length and the number
of ingredients, let me say that I have made the “polonaise”
frequently at the cost of little more time and
trouble than is required for an ordinary cream or chocolate
cake. I would rather make three such, than
one loaf of rich fruit-cake.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Charlotte Cachée Cake.</span></h3>

<p>1 thick loaf of sponge, or other plain cake.</p>

<p>2 kinds of jelly—tart and sweet.</p>

<p>Whisked whites of 5 eggs.</p>

<p>1 heaping cup powdered sugar—or enough to make stiff icing.</p>

<p>Juice of 1 lemon whipped into the icing.</p>

<p>Cut the cake horizontally into five or six slices of
uniform width. Spread each slice with jelly—first
the tart, then the sweet, and fit them into their former
places. Ice thickly all over, so as to leave no sign
of the slices; set in a slow oven for a few minutes to
harden; then, in a sunny window.</p>

<p>This is an easy way of making a showy cake out of
a plain one.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fanny’s Cake.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>1 pound powdered sugar.</p>

<p>1 pound flour—Hecker’s “prepared.”</p>

<p>¼ pound butter rubbed to a cream with the sugar.</p>

<p>8 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately.</p>

<p>1 coffee-cupful sweet almonds—blanched.</p>

<p>Extract of bitter almond and rose-water.</p>

<p>Blanch the almonds in boiling water. Strip off the
skins and spread them upon a dry cloth until perfectly
cold and crisp. Pound in a Wedgewood mortar, adding
rose-water as you go on, and, at the last, half a
teaspoonful bitter almond extract.</p>

<p>Stir the creamed butter and sugar and yolks together
until <i>very</i> light; add to this the flour, handful
by handful; then the almond paste, alternately with
the whites. Beat vigorously up from the bottom, two
or three minutes.</p>

<p>Bake in small tins, well buttered. When cold, turn
them out and cover tops and sides with—</p>

<h4><i>Almond Icing.</i></h4>

<p>Whites of 3 eggs, whisked to a standing froth.</p>

<p>¾ pound of powdered sugar.</p>

<p>½ pound of sweet almonds blanched and pounded to a paste. When beaten fine and smooth, work gradually into the icing. Flavor with lemon-juice and rose-water.</p>

<p>This frosting is delicious. Dry in the open air when
this is practicable.</p>

<p>1 cup sweet milk.</p>

<p>5 eggs, whites and yolks whipped separately, and the latter strained.</p>

<p>1 pound raisins, stoned, cut in half, dredged with flour, and put into the cake just before it goes into the oven.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Neapolitan Cake.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /> (<i>Yellow, pink, white and brown.</i>)</h3>

<h4><i>Yellow.</i></h4>

<p>2 cups powdered sugar.</p>

<p>1 cup butter stirred to light cream with sugar.</p>

<p>5 eggs—beaten well, yolks and whites separately.</p>

<p>½ cupful sweet milk.</p>

<p>3 cups prepared flour.</p>

<p>A little nutmeg.</p>

<h4><i>Pink and White.</i></h4><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>1 pound sugar—powdered.</p>

<p>1 pound prepared flour.</p>

<p>½ pound butter creamed with sugar.</p>

<p>10 eggs—the whites only—whisked stiff.</p>

<p>Divide this batter into two equal portions. Leave
one white, and color the other with a very little prepared
cochineal. Use it cautiously, as a few drops too
much will ruin the color.</p>

<h4><i>Brown.</i></h4>

<p>3 eggs beaten light.</p>

<p>1 cup powdered sugar.</p>

<p>¼ cup of butter creamed with sugar.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls cream.</p>

<p>1 <i>heaping</i> cup prepared flour.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls vanilla chocolate grated and rubbed smooth in the cream, before it is beaten into the cake.</p>

<p>Bake all in jelly-cake tins. The above quantity
should make one dozen cakes—three of each color. Of
course, half as much will suffice for an ordinary family
baking. But it is convenient to prepare it wholesale
in this manner for a large supper, for a charity bazaar
entertainment, or a church “sociable.”</p>

<p>Whip up well. Lay the brown cake as the foundation
of the pile; spread with the yellow custard. Put
the pink, coated with chocolate, next, and the white
frosting between the third and fourth cakes—<i>i.e.</i> the
white and yellow. You can vary the order as your
fancy dictates. Cover the top with powdered sugar, or
ice it.</p>

<p>This cake looks very handsome cut into slices and
mixed with plain, in baskets or salvers. You can
hardly do better than to undertake it, if you have
promised a liberal contribution to any of the objects
above named.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful mixed mace and cinnamon.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful soda, dissolved in hot water.</p>

<p>2 teaspoonfuls cream of tartar sifted with flour.</p>

<p>Add the strained yolks to the creamed butter and
sugar; to this, the cream and soda—then, in alternate
supplies, the whites and flour; finally, spice and brandy.
Beat up hard for three minutes, and bake in two
square loaves. The oven should not be too quick, but
steady. Cover with paper if the cake shows signs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
crustiness on the top before it has risen to the proper
height. It should bake one hour.</p>

<p>It is a good cake, and keeps well.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Morris Cake.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 cups powdered sugar.</p>

<p>4 cups flour.</p>

<p>5 eggs beaten light, the yolks strained.</p>

<p>1 rather large cup <i>sour</i> cream, or loppered milk.</p>

<p>½ grated nutmeg.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful vanilla.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in hot water.</p>

<p>Stir beaten yolks, butter, and sugar together, and
beat <i>very</i> light. Put in nutmeg and vanilla, the sour
cream, half the flour, the soda-water, and the rest of
the flour. Beat with steady strokes five minutes, bringing
up batter from the bottom of the bowl at every
sweep of the wooden spoon. In this way you drive
the air into the cells of the egg-batter, instead of <i>out</i>
of them. This is a knack in the cake-maker’s art that
is too little understood and practised.</p>

<p>Remember, then, that the <i>motion should always be
upward, and the spoon always come up full</i>.</p>

<p>Bake in two loaves, or several smaller ones. The
oven should not be too quick.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Rose Cake.</span> (<i>Very pretty.</i>) <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Whites of 10 eggs, beaten to standing froth.</p>

<p>1 cup butter, creamed with sugar.</p>

<p>3 cups powdered sugar.</p>

<p>1 small cup of sweet cream.</p>

<p><i>Nearly</i> 5 cups prepared flour.</p>

<p>Vanilla flavoring, and liquid cochineal.</p>

<p>Stir the cream (into which it is safe to put a pinch of
soda) into the butter and sugar. Beat five minutes
with “the Dover,” until the mixture is like whipped
cream. Flavor with vanilla, and put in by turns the
whites and the flour. Color a fine pink with cochineal.
Bake in four jelly-cake tins. When cold, spread with,</p>

<h4><i>Filling.</i></h4>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>1½ cocoanuts, pared and grated.</p>

<p>Whites of 4 eggs, whisked stiff.</p>

<p>1½ cups powdered sugar.</p>

<p>2 teaspoonfuls best rose-water.</p>

<p>Instead of cochineal, you can use strawberry or currant
juice in their season, making allowance for the
thinning of your batter, by adding a little more flour.
Cochineal is much better, however, since it takes but a
few drops to color the whole cake. Any druggist will
prepare it for you as he does for the confectioners, as a
liquid. Or, he will powder it, and you can add to a
pinch of the grayish crimson-dust a <i>very</i> little water;
strain it, and stir in, drop by drop, until you get the
right tint. It is without taste or odor, and is perfectly
harmless.</p>

<p>Heap the cake after it is filled, with the white mixture,
beating more sugar into that portion intended

<p>4 cups flour.</p>

<p>1 cup of butter.</p>

<p>3 cups powdered sugar.</p>

<p>8 eggs, beaten light. Strain the yolks.</p>

<p>1 cup cream, or rich milk.</p>

<p>1 pound sultana (seedless) raisins, dredged thickly.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful soda, dissolved in hot water.</p>

<p>2 smaller teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar.</p>

<p>½ grated nutmeg, and ½ teaspoonful of cinnamon.</p>

<p>Cream the butter and sugar. Sift the cream of tartar
with the flour. Dredge the raisins with flour when
you have picked them over with great care, washed
and dried them.</p>

<p>Mix the beaten yolks with the creamed butter and
sugar; then, the spice and brandy. Beat three minutes,
and stir in the cream or milk lightly with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
soda-water. Put in, first a handful of one, then a
spoonful of the other, the flour and whipped whites.
At last, beat in the fruit.</p>

<p>Bake in two large loaves, or four smaller ones. My
own preference is for small loaves of cake. They are
safer in baking, and can be cut more economically,
especially where the family is not large. It is better to
cut up the whole of a small cake for one meal, than to
halve or quarter a large one, since the outer slices must
be dry at the next cutting, and are wasted, to say nothing
of the effect of the air upon the whole of the exposed
interior.</p>

<p>The Sultana must be baked slowly and carefully, and
like all fruit-cakes, longer than a plain one. Ice
thickly. It will keep very well.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">My Lady’s Cake.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 cups powdered sugar.</p>

<p>½ cup butter, creamed with the sugar.</p>

<p>Whites of 5 eggs, whisked stiff.</p>

<p>1 cup of milk.</p>

<p>3 full cups of prepared flour.</p>

<p>Flavor with vanilla.</p>

<p>Bake in jelly-cake tins.</p>

<h4><i>Filling.</i></h4>

<p>1 cup sweet cream, whipped stiff.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls powdered sugar.</p>

<p>½ cup grated cocoanut, stirred in lightly at the last.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful rose-water.</p>

<p>A very delicate and delicious cake, but must be
eaten very soon after it is made, since the cream will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
be sour or stale after twenty-four hours. It is best on
the day in which it is made.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cocoanut and Almond Cake.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2½ cups powdered sugar.</p>

<p>1 cup of butter.</p>

<p>4 full cups prepared flour.</p>

<p>Whites of 7 eggs, whisked stiff.</p>

<p>1 small cup of milk, with a mere pinch of soda.</p>

<p>1 grated cocoanut.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful nutmeg.</p>

<p>Juice and half the grated peel of 1 lemon.</p>

<p>Cream butter and sugar; stir in lemon and nutmeg.
Mix well, add the milk, the whites and flour alternately.
Lastly, stir in the grated cocoanut swiftly and lightly.</p>

<p>Bake in four jelly-cake tins.</p>

<h4><i>Filling.</i></h4>

<p>1 pound sweet almonds.</p>

<p>Whites of 4 eggs, whisked stiff.</p>

<p>1 heaping cup powdered sugar.</p>

<p>2 teaspoonfuls rose-water.</p>

<p>Blanch the almonds. Let them get cold and dry.
Then pound in a Wedgewood mortar, adding rose-water,
as you go on. Save about two dozen to shred for the
top. Stir the paste into the icing after it is made;
spread between the cooled cakes. Make that for the
top a trifle thicker, and lay it on heavily. When it
has stiffened somewhat, stick the shred almonds closely
over it. Set in the oven to harden, but do not let it
scorch.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Coffee Cake.</span></h3>

<p>5 cups flour, dried and sifted.</p>

<p>1 cup of butter.</p>

<p>2 cups of sugar.</p>

<p>1 cup of molasses.</p>

<p>1 cup made black coffee—the very best quality.</p>

<p>½ pound raisins, seeded and minced.</p>

<p>½ pound currants, washed and dried.</p>

<p>¼ pound citron, chopped fine.</p>

<p>3 eggs, beaten very light.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful cinnamon.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful mace.</p>

<p>¼ teaspoonful cloves.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful—a full one—of <i>saleratus</i>.</p>

<p>Cream the butter and sugar, warm the molasses
slightly, and beat these, with the spices, hard, five
minutes, until the mixture is very light. Next, put in
the yolks, the coffee, and when these are well mixed,
the flour, in turn with the whipped whites. Next, the
saleratus, dissolved in hot water, and the fruit, all
mixed together and dredged well with flour. Beat up
very thoroughly, and bake in two loaves, or in small
round tins.</p>

<p>The flavor of this cake is peculiar, but to most
palates very pleasant. Wrap in a thick cloth as soon
as it is cold enough to put away without danger
of “sweating,” and shut within your cake box, as it
soon loses the aroma of the coffee if exposed to the
air.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>Cream butter and sugar; warm the molasses slightly
and beat into this with spices and cream. Add the
yolks of the eggs, stir in the flour and the whites
alternately, the soda-water, then the fruit, well dredged
with flour. Beat all together vigorously for at least
three minutes before putting into well-buttered tins to
be baked.</p>

<p>It will require long and careful baking, the molasses
rendering it liable to burn.</p>

<p>A pinch of soda, dissolved in hot water.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls carraway seed.</p>

<p>¼ pound of citron shred very small.</p>

<p>Mix flour, cream, half the butter (melted) and the
yeast together; work up very well and set to rise for
six hours. When very light, work in the rest of the
butter rubbed to a cream with the sugar, the soda-water,
and when these ingredients are thoroughly incorporated,
the seed and citron. Let it rise three-quarters
of an hour longer—until it almost fills the
pans—and bake steadily half an hour if you have put
it in small pans, an hour, if it is in large loaves. This

<p>2 cups of sugar.</p>

<p>¾ cup of butter.</p>

<p>2½ cups prepared flour, or enough to make pound-cake batter. With some brands you may need 3 cups.</p>

<p>½ pound citron cut in thin shreds.</p>

<p>Juice of an orange and 1 teaspoonful grated peel.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Rich Almond Cake.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>½ pound sweet almonds, blanched and pounded.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful orange-flower water.</p>

<p>Nutmeg.</p>

<p>Beat butter and sugar ten minutes until they are
like whipped cream; add the strained yolks, the whites
and flour alternately with one another, then the almond
paste in which the orange-flower water has been mixed
as it was pounded, and the nutmeg. Beat well and
bake as “snow balls,” in small round, rather deep pans,

<h3><span class="smcap">A Charlotte à la Parisienne.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 large stale sponge-cake.</p>

<p>1 cup rich sweet custard.</p>

<p>1 cup sweet cream, whipped.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls rose-water.</p>

<p>½ grated cocoanut.</p>

<p>½ pound sweet almonds, blanched and pounded.</p>

<p>Whites of 4 eggs, whipped stiff.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Cut the cake in horizontal slices the whole breadth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
of the loaf. They should be about half an inch thick.
Divide the whipped eggs into two portions; into one
stir the cocoanut with half the sugar; into the other
the almond paste with the rest of the sugar. Spread
the slices with these mixtures,—half with the cocoanut,
half with almond, and replace them in their original
form, laying aside the top-crust for a lid. Press
all the sliced cake firmly together, that the slices may
not slip, and with a sharp knife cut a deep cup out of
the centre down to the bottom slice, which must be
left entire. Take out the rounds you have cut, leaving
walls an inch thick, and soak the part removed in a
bowl with the custard. Rub it to a smooth batter, and
whip it into the frothed cream. The rose-water in the
almond paste will flavor it sufficiently. When it is a
stiff rich cream, fill the cavity of the cake with it, put
on the lid, and ice with the following:</p>

<p>Whites of 3 eggs.</p>

<p>1 heaping cup of powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Juice of 1 lemon.</p>

<p>Beat stiff and cover the sides and top of the cake.
Set in a very cold place until needed.</p>

<p>This is a delicious and elegant Charlotte.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful cinnamon.</p>

<p>1 heaping teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in hot water.</p>

<p>Nearly 4 cups of flour.</p>

<p>Mix, and bake quickly, adding the soda-water last,
and beating hard for two minutes after it goes in.</p>

<p>4 eggs, beaten very light.</p>

<p>1 cup of sour <i>cream</i>.</p>

<p>4½ cups of flour.</p>

<p>Juice of 1 lemon, and half the grated peel.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful of cinnamon.</p>

<p>½ grated nutmeg.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful ginger.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in hot water.</p>

<p>Bake in two loaves. It is very nice, and will keep
several days if wrapped in a thick cloth.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Half-Cup Gingerbread.</span></h3>

<p>½ cup of sugar.</p>

<p>½ cup of butter.</p>

<p>½ cup of best molasses.</p>

<p>½ cup of sour milk.</p>

<p>½ pound of eggs.</p>

<p>½ pound of flour, <i>or</i> enough for good batter.</p>

<p>½ coffee-cup of raisins, seeded and halved.</p>

<p>½ table-spoonful ginger.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful cinnamon.</p>

<p>½ <i>dessert</i>-spoonful soda, dissolved in hot water.</p>

<p>Cream butter, sugar, molasses and spices. Beat
thoroughly before adding yolks and milk. Put in flour
and whites alternately, then the soda-water. Mix well,
and stir in the fruit dredged with flour.</p>

<p>Bake in one card or loaf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>1 cup of butter.</p>

<p>2 cups of powdered sugar, creamed with butter.</p>

<p>½ cup of sweet milk.</p>

<p>4 eggs.</p>

<p>3 cups of prepared flour.</p>

<p>½ grated nutmeg.</p>

<p>½ pound currants, washed, dried and dredged.</p>

<p>Put the fruit in last. Bake in cups or small pans.
They are very nice for luncheon or tea—very convenient
for Sabbath-school suppers and picnics.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cocoanut Cakes.</span> (<i>Small.</i>)</h3>

<p>1 grated cocoanut.</p>

<p>1 cup powdered sugar.</p>

<p>3 eggs—the whites only, whipped stiff.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful corn-starch, wet in the milk of the cocoanut.</p>

<p>Rose-water flavoring.</p>

<p>Whip the sugar into the stiffened whites; then the
corn-starch, the cocoanut and rose-water last. Beat up
well, and drop by the spoonful upon buttered paper.</p>

<p>Bake half an hour.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rose Drop Cakes.</span> (<i>Cocoanut.</i>)</h3>

<p>Mix as directed in last receipt, coloring the <i>méringue</i>
before you put in the cocoanut, with liquid cochineal.
Add cautiously until you get the right tint.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Variegated Cakes.</span></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>1 cup of powdered sugar.</p>

<p>½ cup of butter, creamed with the sugar.</p>

<p>½ cup of milk.</p>

<p>4 eggs—the whites only, whipped light.</p>

<p>2½ cups of prepared flour.</p>

<p>Bitter-almond flavoring.</p>

<p>Spinach-juice and cochineal.</p>

<p>Cream butter and sugar, add the milk, flavoring the
whites and flour. Divide the batter into three parts.
Bruise and pound a few leaves of spinach in a thin
muslin bag, until you can express the juice. Put a few
drops of this into one portion of the batter, color another
with cochineal, leaving the third white. Put a
little of each into small round pans or cups, giving a
slight stir to each color as you add the next. This will
vein the cakes prettily. Put the white between the
pink and green, that the tints may show better.</p>

<p>If you can get pistachio-nuts to pound up for the
green, the cakes will be much nicer.</p>

<p>Ice on sides and top.</p>

<p>1 cup of butter.</p>

<p>2 cups of sugar.</p>

fluted shells are very pretty.</p>

<p>Juice of 1 lemon, and half the grated peel.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful of soda, wet up with hot water.</p>

Drop the mixture by the spoonful, upon buttered paper,
taking care that they are not so close together as to
touch in baking.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful of nutmeg.</p>

<p>A handful of currants, washed and dried.</p>

<p>Mix all except the fruit, into a dough just stiff
enough to roll out. The sheet should be about a quarter

When about half done open the oven-door; strew a
few currants upon each cookey, and close the door
again immediately, lest the cakes should get chilled.</p>

Mix all together, and add the flour lightly and rapidly.</p>

<p>Bake in well-buttered <i>paté</i>-pans, or other small tins,
very quickly. Turn out as soon as done upon a baking-pan,

<p>Some good puff-paste.</p>

<p>Whites of 2 eggs, ½ cup sweet jelly.</p>

<p>1 cup of cream, whipped to a froth.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Vanilla, or other flavoring.</p>

<p>Roll out the paste as for pies; cut into squares five
inches across. Have ready greased muffin-rings three
inches in diameter; lay one in the centre of each
square; turn up the four corners upon it, so as to make
a cup of the paste, and bake in a quick oven. When
<i>almost</i> done, open the oven-door, pull out the muffin-rings
with care, brush the paste cups inside and out
with beaten white of egg; sift powdered sugar over
them, and brown. This operation must be performed
quickly and dexterously, that the paste may not cool.
Let them get cold after they are taken from the oven,
line with the jelly and fill with the whipped cream
sweetened and flavored.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Custard Cakes.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>3 or 4 table-spoonfuls powdered sugar.</p>

<p>2 eggs.</p>

<p>2 cups—more or less, of rich custard.</p>

<p>Roll out the paste <i>very</i> thin; spread it thickly with
beaten yolk of egg, and strew powdered sugar over
this. Fold up tightly; flatten with the rolling-pin, and
roll out as for a pie-crust. Line paté-pans well greased
with this; put a ball of soft paper within each to keep
up the top crust; put this on, lightly buttering the
inner edge, and bake quickly until nicely browned.
When almost cold, turn out of the tins, lift the top
crusts, take out the papers and cover the tops with
icing made of the whites of the eggs and powdered
sugar. Sift more sugar over this, and set in the oven
a minute or two to harden. Just before sending them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>

and serve.</p>

<p>They are very good. It is well to thicken the custard
with a little corn-starch.</p>

<p>4 cups of flour, or enough for soft dough.</p>

<p>Season to taste with nutmeg.</p>

<p>Roll into a sheet nearly an inch thick. Cut into

Drain off every drop of fat; sift powdered sugar over
the cakes while hot, and eat fresh.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Genuine Scotch Short Bread.</span> (<i>Very fine.</i>)</h3>

<p>2 pounds flour.</p>

<p>1 pound best butter.</p>

<p>Scant ½ pound of sugar.</p>

<p>Wash all particles of salt from the butter. Rub
this and the sugar together to a cream, as for loaf cake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
The flour should be dry and slightly warm. Mix this
into the creamed butter and sugar gently and gradually
with the hand, until all the ingredients are thoroughly
incorporated. The longer it is kneaded the better it
will be. Lay it on a pasteboard, and press into sheets
nearly half an inch thick with the hand, as rolling has
a tendency to toughen it. Cut into such shapes as you
may desire—into oblong, or square cards; prick or
stamp a pattern on top (I have seen the Scotch thistle
pricked upon it) and bake in a moderate oven until it
is crisp, and of a fine yellow brown.</p>

<p>It delights me to be able to make public this receipt,
for the excellent housewife and friend, from whom I
have procured it, is a native of the “land o’ cakes,”
and, as I can testify from repeated and satisfactory
proofs thereof, makes the most delicious “short bread”
that was ever eaten in this country—quite another
thing from the rank, unctuous compound vended under
that name by professional bakers and confectioners.</p>

<h2>TEA.<br />
————————<br /></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> evening meal, call it by whatever name we
may, is apt to be the most social one of the three which
are the rule in this land. The pressure of the business
allotted to the hours of daylight is over. The
memory and the conversation of each one who comes
to the feast, are richer by the history of another day. It
is sometimes hard to “make talk” for the breakfast
table. The talk of the six o’clock <small>P.M.</small> dinner, or
supper, or tea, makes itself. I frankly own that, however
much may be said in favor, on hygienic grounds,
of early meals for the nursery, the mid-day dinner for
adults has always worn for me a grim, and certainly an
unpoetical aspect. The “nooning” should, for the
worker with muscles, nerves, or brains, be a light repast
and easily digested, followed by real physical rest.
He is weary when he comes to it; he eats in haste, his
mind intent upon the afternoon’s work, and he may not
tarry when it is dispatched, having already “lost” an
hour in discussing (or bolting) soup, salad, fish, meat
and dessert. The weight of undigested food seems,
during the succeeding hours of business or study, to
shift its position and clog and heat the brain.</p>

<p>“I will not preach to roast-beef and plum-pudding!”
said America’s greatest preacher, in refusing to hold a
Sabbath afternoon service.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>People quoted the <i>bon mot</i> approvingly. Few had
common sense enough to apply it to week-day occupations.
If men and women would rest, after an early
dinner on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday and Saturday, as long and absolutely as they
do on Sabbath afternoons, there would be less money
made, perhaps, but fewer stomachs destroyed, and fewer
intellects overstrained.</p>

<p>This, however, as Paul candidly remarks touching
certain of his deliverances—“I say of mine own judgment.”
And, after all, I should be the sorriest of the
sorry to see the tea-table swept out of American
households. While I write, there come stealing back
to me recollections that tempt me to draw my pen
through some lines I have just set down. Late dinners
and late suppers used to be the fashion, seldom
altered—in Southern homes. In summer, the latter
were always eaten by artificial light. In winter, lamps
were brought in with the dessert, at dinner-time. I
was almost grown before I was introduced to what the
valued correspondent who gave us the text for the first
“Familiar Talk” in this volume calls, “a real old New
England tea-table.” During one delicious vacation I
learned, and reveled in knowing, what this meant.
Black tea with cream, (I have never relished it without,
since that idyllic summer) rounds of brown bread,
light, sweet, and fresh; hot short-cake in piles that
were very high when we sat down, and very low when
we arose; a big glass bowl of raspberries and currants
that were growing in the garden under the back windows
an hour before; a basket of frosted cake; a plate
of pink ham, balanced by one of shaved, <i>not</i> chipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
beef—and <i>sage cheese!</i> I had never eaten it before.
I have never tasted it anywhere else than in that wide,
cool tea-room, the level sun-rays flickering through the
grape-vines shading the west side of the house, and
through the open casements opposite, a view of Boston
bay—all purple and rose and gold, dotted with hundreds
of white sails. This was what we had, when, in
that Old New England farm-house, Polly, the faithful—who
had startled me, for a time, by saying, “proper
glad,” and “sweet pretty;” who “hadn’t ought” to do
this, and “should admire” to do that—Polly, whom
nobody thought of calling a servant, but was a “help”
in every conceivable sense of the word—had “put the
kettle on and we all had tea!”</p>

<p>I do not like to think it possible that in that beloved
homestead they may have kept up with the times so
far as to have dinner at six o’clock, and tea—never!</p>

<p>It is a pleasant practice, in many families, where
the late dinner is convenient, and, for many reasons,
preferred during the rest of the week, to have a “comfortable
tea” on Sabbath evening. The servants are
thus released the earlier for their evening’s devotions
or recreations; the housewife has an opportunity of
indulging the father, who is seldom at home at luncheon-time,
with dainty wonders of her skill that are not
<i>en règle</i> at dinner, and the children have a taste of old-fashioned
home-life, the memory of which will be
carried by them as long and fondly into their after-lives
as I have borne the taste and fragrance of Cousin
Melissa’s sage cheese. We do not say “Cousin,” nowadays
in polite society, nor christen our children
Melissa. You will find elsewhere in this book that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
have directed you, as preliminary to frosting fruit for
dessert—peaches, apricots and nectarines—first to rub
off the down (which makes the softness of the blush)
with a rough cloth.</p>

<p>It may be a weakness, but I, for one, like to remember
while admiring the pretty conceit of the <i>glacé</i>
peach, how it looked before it was rubbed bright, and
sugar-coated.</p>

<h2>BEVERAGES.<br />
————————<br /></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tea à la Russe.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Slice</span> fresh, juicy lemons; pare them carefully, lay
a piece in the bottom of each cup; sprinkle with white
sugar and pour the tea, very hot and strong, over them.</p>

<h4><i>Or,</i></h4>

<p>Send around the sliced lemon with the cups of tea,
that each person may squeeze in the juice to please
himself. Some leave the peel on, and profess to like
the bitter flavor which it imparts to the beverage. The
truth is, the taste for this (now) fashionable refreshment
is so completely an acquired liking, that you had
best leave to your guests the matter of “peel on” or
“peel off.” There are those whom not even fashion
can reconcile to the peculiar “smack” of lemon-rind
after it has been subjected to the action of a boiling
liquid.</p>

<p>Tea <i>à la Russe</i> is generally, if not invariably drunk
without cream, and is plentifully sweetened. It is very
popular at the “high teas” and “kettle-drums,” so
much in vogue at this time,—tea being to women, say
the cynics, a species of mild intoxicant, of which they
are not to be defrauded by evening dinners and their
<i>sequitur</i> of black coffee. Others, who cleave to ancient
customs, and distrust innovations of all kinds,
will have it that the popularity of these feminine
carousals has its root in remorseful hankering after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
almost obsolete “family tea.” “Since there must be
fashionable follies,” growl these critics, “this is as
harmless as any that can be devised, and is, assuredly,
less disastrous to purse and health than an evening
crush and supper.”</p>

<p>For once, we say “Amen” to the croakers. The
“kettle-drum” is objectionable in nothing except its
absurd name, and marks a promising era in the history
of American party-giving.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cold Tea.</span></h3>

<p>Mixed tea is better cold than either black or green
alone. Set it aside after breakfast, for luncheon or
for tea, straining it into a perfectly clean and sweet
bottle, and burying it in the ice. When ready to use
it, you must fill a goblet three-quarters of the way to
the top with the clear tea; sweeten it more lavishly
than you would hot, and fill up the glass with cracked
ice. It is a delicious beverage in summer. Drink
without cream.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Iced Tea à la Russe.</span></h3>

<p>To each goblet of cold tea (without cream), add the
juice of half a lemon. Fill up with pounded ice, and
sweeten well. A glass of champagne added to this
makes what is called Russian punch.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tea Milk-punch.</span></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>1 egg beaten very light.</p>

<p>1 small glass new milk.</p>

<p>1 cup very hot tea.</p>

<p>Sugar to taste.</p>

<p>Beat a teaspoonful or so of sugar with the egg; stir
in the milk and then the hot tea, beating all up well
together, and sweetening to taste. This is a palatable
mixture, and is valuable for invalids who suffer much
from weakness, or the peculiar sensation known as a
“cold stomach.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A “Cozy” for a Teapot.</span></h3>

<p>This is not an article of diet, yet an accessory to good
tea-making and enjoyable tea-drinking that deserves to
be better known in America. It is a wadded cover or
bag made of crotcheted worsted, or of silk, velvet or
cashmere, stitched or embroidered as the maker may
fancy, with a stout ribbon-elastic drawn loosely in the
bottom. This is put over the teapot so soon as the tea
is poured into it, and will keep the contents of the pot
warm for an hour or more. Those who have known
the discomfort, amounting to actual nausea, produced
by taking a draught of lukewarm tea into an empty
or weary stomach; or whose guests or families are
apt to keep them waiting for their appearance at
table until the “cheering” (if hot) “beverage” lowers
in temperature and quality so grievously that it must
be remanded to the kitchen, and an order for fresh
issued—will at once appreciate the importance of
this simple contrivance for keeping up the heat of our
“mild intoxicant” and keeping the temper of the
priestess at the tea-tray down.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coffee with Whipped Cream.</span></h3>

<p>For six cups of coffee, of fair size, you will need
about one cup of sweet cream, whipped light with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
little sugar. Put into each cup the desired amount of
sugar, and about a table-spoonful of boiling milk. Pour
the coffee over these, and lay upon the surface of the
hot liquid a large spoonful of the frothed cream.
Give a gentle stir to each cup before sending them
around. This is known to some as <i>méringued</i> coffee, and
is an elegant French preparation of the popular drink.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Frothed Café au Lait.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart strong, clear coffee, strained through muslin.</p>

<p>1 Scant quart boiling milk.</p>

<p>Whites of 3 eggs, beaten stiff.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful powdered sugar, whipped with the eggs.</p>

<p>Your coffee urn must be scalded clean, and while it
is hot, pour in the coffee and milk alternately, stirring
gently. Cover; wrap a thick cloth about the urn for
five minutes, before it goes to table. Have ready in a
cream-pitcher the whipped and sweetened whites. Put
a large spoonful upon each cup of coffee as you pour
it out, heaping it slightly in the centre.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Frothed Chocolate.</span> (<i>Very good.</i>)</h3>

<p>1 cup of boiling water.</p>

<p>3 pints of fresh milk.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls Baker’s chocolate, grated.</p>

<p>5 eggs, the whites only, beaten light.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls of sugar, powdered for froth.</p>

<p>Sweeten the chocolate to taste.</p>

<p>Heat the milk to scalding. Wet up the chocolate
with the boiling water and when the milk is hot, stir
this into it. Simmer gently ten minutes, stirring frequently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
Boil up briskly once, take from the fire,
sweeten to taste, taking care not to make it too sweet,
and stir in the whites of two eggs, whipped stiff, <i>without</i>
sugar. Pour into the chocolate pot or pitcher,
which should be well heated. Have ready in a cream
pitcher, the remaining whites whipped up with the
powdered sugar. Cover the surface of each cup with the
sweetened <i>méringue</i>, before distributing to the guests.</p>

<p>If you like, you can substitute scented chocolate
for Baker’s.</p>

<p>Chocolate or cocoa is a favorite luncheon beverage,
and many ladies, especially those who have spent much
time abroad, have adopted the French habit of breakfasting
upon rolls and a cup of chocolate.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Milled Chocolate.</span></h3>

<p>3 heaping table-spoonfuls of grated chocolate.</p>

<p>1 quart of milk.</p>

<p>Wet the chocolate with boiling water. Scald the
milk and stir in the chocolate-paste. Simmer ten
minutes; then, if you have no regular “muller,” put
your syllabub-churn into the boiling liquid and churn
steadily, without taking from the fire, until it is a
yeasty froth. Pour into a chocolate-pitcher, and serve
at once.</p>

<p>This is esteemed a great delicacy by chocolate lovers,
and is easily made.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Soyer’s Café au Lait.</span></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>1 cup best coffee, freshly roasted, but <i>unground</i>.</p>

<p>2 cups of boiling water.</p>

<p>1 quart boiling milk.</p>

<p>Put the coffee into a <i>clean</i>, dry kettle or tin pail; fit
on a close top and set in a saucepan of boiling water.
Shake it every few moments, without opening it, until
you judge that the coffee-grains must be heated
through. If, on lifting the cover, you find that the
contents of the inner vessel are very hot and smoking,
pour over them the boiling water directly from the
tea-kettle. Cover the inner vessel closely and set on
the side of the range, where it will keep <i>very</i> hot without
boiling for twenty minutes. Then, add the boiling
milk, let all stand together for five minutes more,
and strain through thin muslin into the coffee-urn.
Use loaf-sugar in sweetening.</p>

<p>The flavor of this is said to be very fine.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">White Lemonade.</span></h3>

<p>3 lemons.</p>

<p>3 cups loaf sugar.</p>

<p>2 glasses white wine.</p>

<p>2 quarts <i>fresh</i> milk, boiling hot.</p>

<p>Wash the lemons, grate all the peel from one into
a bowl; add the sugar, and squeeze the juice of the
three over these. After two hours add the wine,
and then, quickly, the boiling milk. Strain through a
flannel jelly-bag. Cool and set in the ice until wanted.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Claret Cup.</span></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>1 (quart) bottle of claret.</p>

<p>1 (pint) bottle of champagne.</p>

<p>½ pint best sherry.</p>

<p>2 lemons, sliced.</p>

<p>¼ pound loaf sugar dissolved in 1 cup cold water.</p>

<p>Let the sugar, water and sliced lemon steep together
half an hour before adding to the rest of the ingredients.
Shake all well together in a very large pitcher
twenty or thirty times, and make thick with pounded
ice, when you are ready to use it.</p>

<p>There is no better receipt for the famous “claret
cup” than this.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Very Fine Porteree.</span></h3>

<p>1 pint bottle best porter.</p>

<p>2 glasses pale sherry.</p>

<p>1 lemon <i>peeled</i> and sliced.</p>

<p>½ pint ice-water.</p>

<p>6 or 8 lumps of loaf sugar.</p>

<p>½ grated nutmeg.</p>

<p>Pounded ice.</p>

<p>This mixture has been used satisfactorily by invalids,
for whom the pure porter was too heavy, causing
biliousness and heartburn.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ginger Cordial.</span></h3>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls ground ginger, fresh and strong.</p>

<p>1 lb. loaf sugar.</p>

<p>½ pint best whiskey.</p>

<p>1 quart red currants.</p>

<p>Juice of 1 lemon.</p>

<p>Crush the currants in a stone vessel with a wooden
beetle, and strain them through a clean, coarse cloth,
over the sugar. Stir until the sugar is dissolved; add
the lemon, the whiskey, and the ginger. Put it into a
demijohn or a stone jug, and set upon the cellar-floor
for a week, shaking up vigorously every day. At the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
of that time, strain through a cloth and bottle. Seal
and wire the corks, and lay the bottles on their sides
in a cool, dry place.</p>

<p>An excellent summer drink is made by putting two
table-spoonfuls of this mixture into a goblet of iced
water. It is far safer for quenching the thirst, when
one is overheated, than plain ice-water or lemonade.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Milk-Punch.</span> (<i>Hot.</i>)</h3>

<p>1 quart milk, warm from the cow.</p>

<p>2 glasses best sherry wine.</p>

<p>4 table-spoonfuls powdered sugar.</p>

<p>4 eggs, the yolks only, beaten light.</p>

<p>Cinnamon and nutmeg to taste.</p>

<p>Bring the milk to the boiling point. Beat up the
yolks and sugar together; add the wine; pour into a
pitcher, and mix with it, stirring all the time, the
boiling milk. Pour from one vessel to another six
times, spice, and serve as soon as it can be swallowed
without scalding the throat.</p>

<p>This is said to be an admirable remedy for a bad
cold if taken in the first stages, just before going to
bed at night.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mulled Ale.</span></h3>

<p>3 eggs, the yolks only.</p>

<p>A pint of good ale.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls loaf sugar.</p>

<p>A pinch of ginger, and same of nutmeg.</p>

<p>Heat the ale scalding hot, but do not let it quite
boil. Take from the fire and stir in the eggs beaten
with the sugar, and the spice. Pour from pitcher to
pitcher, five or six times, until it froths, and drink hot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mulled Wine.</span></h3>

<p>2 eggs, beaten very light with the sugar.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful white sugar.</p>

<p>2 full glasses white wine.</p>

<p>½ cup boiling water.</p>

<p>A little nutmeg.</p>

<p>Heat the water, add the wine; cover closely and
bring almost to a boil. Pour this carefully over the
beaten egg and sugar; set in a vessel of boiling water
and stir constantly until it begins to thicken. Pour
into a silver goblet, grate the nutmeg on the top, and let
the invalid drink it as hot as it can be swallowed without
suffering.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Summer Drink.</span> (<i>Very good.</i>)</h3>

<p>2 lbs. Catawba grapes.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls loaf sugar.</p>

<p>1 cup of cold water.</p>

<p>Squeeze the grapes hard in a coarse cloth, when you
have picked them from the stems. Wring out every
drop of juice; add the sugar, and when this is dissolved,
the water, surround with ice until very cold;
put a lump of ice into a pitcher, pour the mixture
upon it, and drink at once.</p>

<p>You can add more sugar if you like, or if the grapes
are not quite ripe.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rum Milk-Punch.</span></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>1 cup milk, warm from the cow.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of best rum.</p>

<p>1 egg, whipped light with a little sugar.</p>

<p>A little nutmeg.</p>

<p>Pour the rum upon the egg-and-sugar; stir for a
moment and add the milk; strain and drink.</p>

<p>It is a useful stimulant for consumptives, and should
be taken before breakfast.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Clear Punch.</span></h3>

<p>½ cup ice-water.</p>

<p>1 glass white wine (or very good whiskey).</p>

<p>White of 1 egg whipped stiff with the sugar.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of loaf sugar.</p>

<p>A sprig of mint.</p>

<p>Pounded ice.</p>

<p>Mix well together and give to the patient, ice-cold.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Currant and Raspberry Shrub.</span></h3>

<p>4 quarts ripe currants.</p>

<p>3 quarts red raspberries.</p>

<p>4 lbs. loaf sugar.</p>

<p>1 quart best brandy.</p>

<p>Pound the fruit in a stone jar, or wide-mouthed
crock, with a wooden beetle. Squeeze out every drop
of the juice; put this into a porcelain, enamel, or very
clean bell-metal kettle, and boil hard ten minutes.
Bring to the boil quickly, as slow heating and boiling
has a tendency to darken all acid syrups. Put in the
sugar at the end of the ten minutes, and boil up once
to throw the scum to the top. Take it off; skim, let
it get perfectly cold, skim off all remaining impurities,
add the brandy and shake hard for five minutes. Bottle;
seal the corks, and lay the bottles on their sides in
dry sawdust.</p>

<p>Put up in this way, “shrub” will keep several years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
and be the better for age. It is a refreshing and slightly
medicinal drink, when mixed with iced water.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Strawberry Shrub.</span></h3>

<p>4 quarts of ripe strawberries.</p>

<p>The juice of 4 lemons.</p>

<p>4 lbs. of loaf sugar.</p>

<p>1 pint best brandy, or colorless whiskey.</p>

<p>Mash the berries and squeeze them through a bag.
Add the strained lemon-juice; bring quickly to a fast
boil, and after it has boiled five minutes, put in the
sugar and cook five minutes more. Skim as it cools,
and, when quite cold, add the brandy. Be sure that
your bottles are perfectly clean. Rinse them out with
soda-and-water; then, with boiling water. The corks
must be new. Soak them in cold water; drive into
the bottles; cut off even with the top; seal with bees-wax
and rosin, melted in equal quantities, and lay the
bottles on their sides in dry sawdust.</p>

<p>Strawberries, preserved in any way, do not keep so
well as some other fruits. Hence, more care must be
taken in putting them up.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon Shrub.</span></h3>

<p>Juice of 6 lemons, and grated peel of two.</p>

<p>Grated peel of 1 orange.</p>

<p>3 lbs. loaf sugar.</p>

<p>3 pints of cold water.</p>

<p>3 pints of brandy or white whiskey.</p>

<p>Steep the grated peel in the brandy for two days.
Boil the sugar-and-water to a thick syrup, and when it
is cool, strain into it the lemon-juice and the liquor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
Shake up well for five minutes, and bottle. Seal the
bottles and lay them on their sides.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Curaçoa.</span></h3>

<p>Grated peel and the juice of 4 fine oranges.</p>

<p>1 lb. of rock-candy.</p>

<p>1 cup of cold water.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful cinnamon.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful nutmeg.</p>

<p>A pinch of cloves.</p>

<p>1 pint very fine brandy.</p>

<p>Break the candy to pieces in a mortar, or, by pounding
it in a cloth, cover with cold water and heat to a
boil, by which time the candy should be entirely dissolved.
Add the orange-juice, boil up once and take
from the fire. When cold, skim, put in the spices,
peel, and brandy; put it into a stone jug, and let it
stand for a fortnight in a cool place. Shake every
day, and at the end of that time strain through flannel,
and bottle.</p>

<p>This is an excellent flavoring for pudding sauces,
custards, trifles, etc. For tipsy Charlottes and like
desserts, it is far superior to brandy or wine.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Noyau.</span></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>½ pound sweet almonds.</p>

<p>Juice of 3 lemons, and grated peel of one.</p>

<p>2 pounds loaf sugar.</p>

<p>3 teaspoonfuls extract of bitter-almonds.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls clear honey.</p>

<p>1 pint best brandy.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful orange-flower water.</p>

<p>Blanch and pound the almonds, mixing the orange-flower
water with them to prevent oiling. Add the
sugar and brandy, and let these ingredients lie together
for two days, shaking the jug frequently. Put in the
lemon, honey and flavoring; shake hard, and leave in
the jug a week longer, shaking it every day.</p>

<p>Strain through very fine muslin, bottle and seal.</p>

<p>The flavor of this is delicious in custards, etc. As a
beverage, it must be mixed with ice-water.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rose Syrup.</span></h3>

<p>1½ pound of fresh rose-leaves.</p>

<p>2 pounds loaf sugar.</p>

<p>Whites of 2 eggs, whipped light.</p>

<p>1 pint best brandy.</p>

<p>1 quart cold water.</p>

<p>Boil the sugar and water to a clear syrup, beat in the
whites of the eggs, and, when it has boiled up again
well, take from the fire. Skim as it cools, and when a
little more than blood-warm, pour it over half a pound
of fresh rose-leaves. Cover it closely, and let it alone
for twenty-four hours. Strain, and put in the second
supply of leaves. On the third day put in the last half
pound, and on the fourth, strain through a muslin bag.
Add the brandy; strain again through a double linen
bag, shake well and bottle.</p>

<p>This liqueur is delightful as a beverage, mixed with
iced water, and invaluable where rose-flavor is desired
for custards, creams or icing.</p>

<p>In the height of the rose-season, the requisite quantity
of leaves may easily be procured. The receipt is
nearly fifty years old.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Orange Cream.</span></h3>

<p>12 large, very sweet oranges.</p>

<p>2 pounds loaf sugar.</p>

<p>1 quart milk, warm from the cow.</p>

<p>1 quart best French brandy.</p>

<p>Grate the peel from three of the oranges, and reserve
for use in preparing the liqueur. Peel the rest, and
use the juice only. Pour this with the brandy over the
sugar and grated rind; put into a stone jug, and let it
stand three days, shaking twice a day.</p>

<p>Then boil the milk, which <i>must</i> be new, and pour hot
over the mixture, stirring it in well. Cover closely.
When it is quite cold, strain through a flannel bag.
Put in clean, sweet bottles, seal the corks, and lay the
bottles on their sides in sawdust.</p>

<p>It will keep well, but will be fit for drinking in a
week. Mix with iced water as a beverage. It is a fine
flavoring liqueur for trifles, etc.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Vanilla Liqueur.</span></h3>

<p>4 fresh vanilla beans.</p>

<p>4 pounds loaf sugar.</p>

<p>1 quart cold water.</p>

<p>1 pint best brandy, or white whiskey.</p>

<p>Split the beans and cut into inch lengths. Put them
to soak in the brandy for three days. Boil the sugar
and water until it is a thick, clear syrup. Skim well,
and strain the vanilla brandy into it. Shake, and pour
into small bottles.</p>

<p>I have called this a liqueur, but it is so highly
flavored as to be unfit for drinking, except as it is used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
in small quantities in effervescing beverages. But it
imparts an exquisite flavor to creams, whips, cakes, etc.,
that cannot be obtained from the distilled extracts.</p>

<p>The receipt was given to me as a modern prize by
an expert in cookery, but in reading it over there
floated to me a delicious breath from a certain storeroom,
the treasures of which to my childish imagination
rivalled those of the “island of delights,” where
the streams were curaçoa and capillaire, and the rocks
loaf sugar. Led by this wandering zephyr of early association,
I did not cease my rummaging until I unearthed
the same receipt from an old cookery-book bequeathed
to me by my mother.</p>

<h2>FLAVORING EXTRACTS.<br />
————————<br /></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon.</span></h3>

<p>The peel of 6 lemons.</p>

<p>1 quart white whiskey or brandy.</p>

<p>Cut the rind into thin shreds; half fill three or four
wide-mouthed bottles with it, and pour the spirits upon
it. Cork tightly, and shake now and then for the first
month. This will keep for years, and be better for
age. It has this advantage over the distilled extract
sold in the stores—country-stores especially, lemon extract
being especially liable to spoil if kept for a few
months, and tasting, when a little old, unfortunately
like spirits of turpentine.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Orange.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare as you would lemon-peel. Put into small
bottles. It is said to be an excellent stomachic taken
in the proportion of a teaspoonful to a glass of iced
water, and slightly sweetened.</p>

<p>It is very nice for flavoring the icing of orange cake.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Vanilla.</span></h3>

<p>2 vanilla beans.</p>

<p>½ pint white whiskey.</p>

<p>Split the bean, and clip with your scissors into
bits, scraping out the seeds which possess the finest
flavoring qualities. Put the seed and husks into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
bottom of a small bottle; fill up with the spirits, and
cork tightly. Shake it often for a few weeks, after
which it will be fit for use—and <i>never spoil</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bitter Almond.</span></h3>

<p>½ pound of bitter almonds.</p>

<p>1 pint white whiskey.</p>

<p>Blanch the almonds, and shred (not pound them),
using for this purpose a sharp knife that will not bruise
the kernels. Put them into a wide-mouthed bottle;
pour in the spirits, cork tightly; shake every other day
for a fortnight. It will then be fit for use. Strain it
as you have occasion to use it, through a bit of cloth
held over the mouth of the bottle.</p>

<p>I introduce these directions for the domestic manufacture
of such extracts as are most used in cooking:,
chiefly, but not altogether for the benefit of country
readers. The land—town and country—is so deluged
now with makers and peddlers of “flavoring extracts,”
that some, of necessity, must be indifferent in quality, if
not hurtful. I have purchased from a respectable
druggist in a large city, rose-water that smelled like
ditch-water, and tasted worse; essence of lemon that
could not be distinguished by the sense of taste or smell
from varnish; and vanilla that was like nothing I had
ever tasted or smelled before—least of all like heliotrope,
new-mown hay, or vanilla-bean.</p>

<p>The answer to my complaint in each of these cases
was the same. “I cannot understand it, madam. The
extract is of Our Own Make, and there is no better in
the American market!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>In country stores the risk of getting a poor article is
of course much greater. To this day, I recall with a
creep of the flesh that drives a cold moisture to the
surface, the unspoken (at the moment) agony with
which I detected something wrong, and very far wrong
in some nice-looking custards, the manufacture of
which I had myself superintended, and that formed
the staple of the dessert, to which I set down a couple
of unexpected guests. As the first spoonful touched
my tongue, I looked at John, and John looked (pityingly)
at me! By mutual consent, we began to press
the fruit upon our friends, and I hastened the entrance
of the coffee-tray.</p>

<p>After dinner, we snatched a few words from one
another, aside.</p>

<p>“The cook’s carelessness!” said he. “She got hold
of the liniment-bottle by mistake.”</p>

<p>“It was a fresh bottle of ‘pure vanilla!’” answered
I solemnly. “I saw her draw the cork!”</p>

<p>It was after this experience that I was assured there
was “no better article in the American market.”</p>

<h2>PRESERVED FRUITS, CANDIES,
ETC.<br />
————————<br /></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Marmalade.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 or 3 dozen tart, juicy apples, pared, cored and sliced.</p>

<p>A little cold water.</p>

<p>¾ pound of sugar to every pint of juice.</p>

<p>Juice of 2 lemons.</p>

<p>Stew the apples until tender, in just enough cold
water to cover them. Drain off the juice through a
cullender, and put into a porcelain or enamel kettle;
stirring into it three-quarters of a pound of sugar for
every pint of the liquid. Boil until it begins to jelly;
strain the lemon-juice into it; put in the apples and
stew pretty fast, stirring almost constantly, until the
compote is thick and smooth. (If the apples are not
soft all through, you had better rub them through the
cullender before adding them to the boiling syrup.)</p>

<p>Put up the marmalade in small jars or cups, and
paste paper covers over them as you would jelly, having
first fitted a round of tissue-paper, dipped in
brandy, upon the surface of the marmalade. Keep
cool and dry.</p>

<p>The simple precaution of covering jellies, jams, and
marmalade with brandied tissue-paper, will save the
housekeeper much annoyance and inconvenience by
protecting the conserve from mould. Should the fungus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
form inside the upper cover, the inner will effectually
shield the precious sweet. I have seen the space
left by the shrinking of the cooled jelly between it and
the metallic, or paper cover of the glass, or jar, completely
filled with blue-gray mould—a miniature forest
that might appear well under the microscope, but was
hideous to housewifely eyes. Yet, when the tissue-paper
was carefully removed, the jelly was seen to be
bright, firm, and unharmed in flavor as in appearance.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pear and Quince Marmalade.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>2 dozen juicy pears.</p>

<p>10 fine, ripe quinces.</p>

<p>Juice of 3 lemons.</p>

<p>¾ pound of sugar to every pound of fruit after it is ready for cooking.</p>

<p>A little cold water.</p>

<p>Pare and core the fruit, and throw it into cold water
while you stew parings and cores in a little water to
make the syrup. When they have boiled to pieces
strain off the liquid; when cold, put in the sliced fruit
and bring to a fast boil. It should be thick and smooth
before the sugar and lemon-juice go in. Cook steadily
an hour longer, working with a wooden spoon to a rich
jelly. When done, put into small jars while warm, but
do not cover until cold.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Orange Marmalade.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>18 sweet, ripe oranges.</p>

<p>6 pounds best white sugar.</p>

<p>Grate the peel from four oranges, and reserve it for
the marmalade. The rinds of the rest will not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
needed. Pare the fruit carefully, removing the inner
white skin as well as the yellow. Slice the orange; remove
the seeds; put the fruit and grated peel in a
porcelain or enamel saucepan (if the latter, those made
by Lalange and Grosjean are the best), and boil steadily
until the pulp is reduced to a smooth mass. Take
from the fire and rub quickly through a clean, bright
cullender, as the color is easily injured. Stir in the
sugar, return to the fire, and boil fast, stirring constantly
half an hour, or until thick. Put while warm
into small jars, but do not cover until cold.</p>

<p>This is a handsome and delicious sweetmeat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dundee Orange Marmalade.</span></h3>

<p>12 fine, ripe oranges.</p>

<p>4 pounds white sugar—the best.</p>

<p>3 lemons—all the juice, and the rind of one lemon.</p>

<p>Cut the peel of four oranges into small dice, and the
rind of one lemon. Stew them in clear water until
tender. Slice and seed the oranges; put them into a
preserving-kettle with the juice of the lemons and cook
until all are boiled down to a smooth pulp. Rub this
through a cullender; return to the saucepan with the
sugar, and keep at a fast boil until quite thick. Stir
in the “dice” from which the water has been drained;
boil two minutes longer and pour into small jars.
Cover with brandied tissue-paper when quite cold,
pressed close to the surface of the marmalade, then,
with metal or stout paper tops.</p>

<p>All marmalade should be stirred constantly after the
sugar goes in.</p>

<p>Use loaf, or granulated sugar for making marmalade—not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
powdered. The crystals are said to make it
more sparkling.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Candied Cherries.</span></h3>

<p>2 quarts large, ripe, red cherries, stoned <i>carefully</i>.</p>

<p>2 lbs. loaf sugar.</p>

<p>1 cup water.</p>

<p>Make a syrup of the sugar and water and boil until
it is thick enough to “pull,” as for candy. Remove to
the side of the range, and stir until it shows signs of
granulation. It is well to stir frequently while it is
cooking, to secure this end. When there are grains, or
crystals on the spoon, drop in the cherries, a few at a
time. Let each supply lie in the boiling syrup two
minutes, when remove to a sieve set over a dish. Shake
gently but long, then turn the cherries out upon a cool,
broad dish, and dry in a sunny window.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Glacé Cherries.</span></h3>

<p>Make as above, but do not let the syrup granulate.
It should not be stirred at all, but when it “ropes,”
pour it over the cherries, which should be spread
out upon a large, flat dish. When the syrup is almost
cold, take these out, one by one, with a teaspoon, and
spread upon a dish to dry in the open air.</p>

<p>If nicely managed, these are nearly as good as those
put up by professional confectioners. Keep in a dry,
cool place.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Candied Lemon-Peel.</span></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>12 fresh, thick-skinned lemons.</p>

<p>4 lbs. loaf sugar.</p>

<p>A little powdered alum.</p>

<p>3 cups clear water.</p>

<p>Cut the peel from the lemons in long, thin strips,
and lay in strong salt and water all night. Wash
them in three waters next morning, and boil them until
tender in soft water. They should be almost translucent,
but not so soft as to break. Dissolve a little
alum—about half a teaspoonful, when powdered—in
enough cold water to cover the peel, and let it lie in it
for two hours. By this time the syrup should be ready.
Stir the sugar into three cups of water, add the strained
juice of three lemons and boil it until it “ropes”
from the end of the spoon. Put the lemon-peels into
this, simmer gently half an hour; take them out and
spread upon a sieve. Shake, not hard, but often, tossing
up the peels now and then, until they are almost dry.
Sift granulated sugar over them and lay out upon a
table spread with a clean cloth. Admit the air freely,
and, when perfectly dry, pack in a glass jar.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Maple Syrup.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>6 lbs. maple sugar—pure.</p>

<p>6 large coffee-cups of water.</p>

<p>Break the sugar to pieces with a stone or hammer;
cover with the water—cold—and let it stand until it is
nearly, or quite melted. Put over the fire and bring
to a gentle boil, leaving the kettle uncovered. Boil,
<i>without stirring</i>, until it is a pretty thick syrup.</p>

<p>If possible, buy maple sugar direct from the “sugar
camps,” or their vicinity, and in large blocks. The
pretty scolloped cakes offered by peanut venders at
treble the price of the genuine article, are largely
adulterated with other substances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cranberries.</span></h3>

<p>Instead of expending my own time in covering a
couple of sheets of paper with receipts touching this
invaluable berry, I would direct the reader’s attention
to the very admirable and comprehensive circular issued
by <span class="smcap">Messrs. C. G. and E. W. Crane</span>, as an accompaniment
to their “First Premium Star Brand Cranberries,”
raised in Ocean County, New Jersey. I have
never seen finer, or tasted more delicious berries than
those sent out with their stamp upon the crates, and I
consider that I am doing my fellow-housekeepers a substantial
service by this unqualified commendation of
the same. The berries are larger, firmer and of richer
flavor than those one is accustomed to see in the markets
(and to buy, knowing no better), and certainly delivered
in a more sightly and wholesome condition.</p>

<p>The receipts go with them, and are clear, safe, and
excellent.</p>

<p>The plantations on which the “Star Berries” are
grown are in Cassville, Ocean County, New Jersey.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peanut Candy.</span> (<i>Very nice.</i>)</h3>

<p>1 scant pint of molasses.</p>

<p>4 quarts of peanuts, measured before they are shelled.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls of vanilla.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful of soda.</p>

<p>Boil the molasses until it hardens in cold water,
when dropped from the spoon. Stir in the vanilla—then
the soda, dry. Lastly, the shelled peanuts. Turn
out into shallow pans well buttered, and press it down
smooth with a wooden spoon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>

<p>I can heartily recommend the candy made according
to this receipt as being unrivalled of its kind.</p>

<p>The molasses should be good in quality, and the
peanuts freshly roasted.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dotty Dimple’s Vinegar Candy.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>3 cups white sugar.</p>

<p>1½ cups clear vinegar.</p>

<p>Stir the sugar into the vinegar until thoroughly dissolved;
heat to a gentle boil and stew, uncovered,
until it ropes from the tip of the spoon. Turn out
upon broad dishes, well buttered, and cool. So soon
as you are able to handle it without burning your
fingers, begin to pull it, using only the tips of your
fingers. It can be “pulled” beautifully white and
porous.</p>

<p>Those who have read Sophie May’s delightful “Little
Prudy,” and “Dotty Dimple” series, will remember
the famous “vinegar candy.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon-Cream Candy.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>6 pounds best white sugar.</p>

<p>Strained juice of 2 lemons.</p>

<p>Grated peel of 1 lemon.</p>

<p>1 teaspoonful of soda.</p>

<p>3 cups clear water.</p>

<p>Steep the grated peel of the lemon in the juice for
an hour; strain, squeezing the cloth hard to get out all
the strength. Pour the water over the sugar, and, when
nearly dissolved, set it over the fire and bring to a boil.
Stew steadily until it hardens in cold water; stir in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
lemon; boil one minute; add the dry soda, stirring in
well; and, instantly, turn out upon broad, shallow
dishes. Pull, as soon as you can handle it, into
long white ropes, and cut into lengths when brittle.</p>

<p>Vanilla cream candy is made in the same way, with
the substitution of vanilla flavoring for the lemon-juice
and peel.</p>

<p>These home-made candies furnish pleasant diversions
for the children on winter evening and rainy days,
and are far more wholesome than those sold in the
shops.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Caramels.</span></h3>

<p>1 cup rich, sweet cream.</p>

<p>1 cup brown sugar.</p>

<p>1 cup white sugar.</p>

<p>7 table-spoonfuls vanilla chocolate.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful corn-starch, stirred into the cream.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of butter.</p>

<p>Vanilla flavoring.</p>

<p>Soda, the size of a pea, stirred into cream.</p>

<p>Boil all the ingredients except the chocolate and
vanilla extract, half an hour, stirring to prevent burning.
Reserve half of the cream and wet up the chocolate
in it, adding a very little water if necessary.
Draw the saucepan to the side of the range, and stir
this in well; put back on the fire and boil ten minutes
longer, quite fast, stirring constantly. When it makes
a hard glossy coat on the spoon, it is done. Add the
vanilla after taking it from the range. Turn into
shallow dishes well buttered. When cold enough to
retain the impression of the knife, cut into squares.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Marbled Cream Candy.</span> (<i>Good.</i>)</h3>

<p>4 cups white sugar.</p>

<p>1 cup rich sweet cream.</p>

<p>1 cup water.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful of butter.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful vinegar.</p>

<p>Bit of soda the size of a pea, stirred in cream.</p>

<p>Vanilla extract.</p>

<p>3 table-spoonfuls of chocolate—grated.</p>

<p>Boil all the ingredients except half the cream, the
chocolate and vanilla, together very fast until it is a
thick, ropy syrup. Heat in a separate saucepan the
reserved cream, into which you must have rubbed the
grated chocolate. Let it stew until quite thick, and
when the candy is done, add a cupful of it to this,
stirring in well.</p>

<p>Turn the uncolored syrup out upon broad dishes,
and pour upon it, here and there, great spoonfuls of
the chocolate mixture. Pull as soon as you can handle
it with comfort, and with the tips of your fingers only.
If deftly manipulated, it will be streaked with white
and brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Cream Drops.</span></h3>

<p>1 cake vanilla chocolate.</p>

<p>3 cups of <i>powdered</i> sugar.</p>

<p>1 cup soft water.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls corn-starch or arrowroot.</p>

<p>1 table-spoonful butter.</p>

<p>2 teaspoonfuls vanilla.</p>

<p>Wash from the butter every grain of salt. Stir the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
sugar and water together; mix in the corn-starch, and
bring to a boil, stirring constantly to induce granulation.
Boil about ten minutes, when add the butter.
Take from the fire and beat as you would eggs, until
it begins to look like granulated cream. Put in the
vanilla; butter your hands well, make the cream into
balls about the size of a large marble, and lay upon a
greased dish.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the chocolate should have been melted
by putting it (grated fine) into a tin pail or saucepan
and plunging it into another of boiling water. When
it is a black syrup, add about two table-spoonfuls of
powdered sugar to it, beat smooth, turn out upon a <i>hot</i>
dish, and roll the cream-balls in it until sufficiently
coated. Lay upon a cold dish to dry, taking care that
they do not touch one another.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sugar Candy.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>6 cups of white sugar.</p>

<p>½ cup of butter.</p>

<p>2 table-spoonfuls of vinegar.</p>

<p>½ teaspoonful of soda.</p>

<p>1 cup cold water.</p>

<p>Vanilla flavoring.</p>

<p>Pour water and vinegar upon the sugar, and let
them stand, without stirring, until the sugar is melted.
Set over the fire and boil fast until it “ropes.” Put
in the butter; boil hard two minutes longer, add the
dry soda, stir it in and take at once from the fire.
Flavor when it ceases to effervesce.</p>

<p>Turn out upon greased dishes, and pull with the tips
of your fingers until white.</p>

<h2>THE SCRAP-BAG.<br />
————————<br /></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">For Sudden Hoarseness.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Roast a lemon in the oven, turning now and then,
that all sides may be equally cooked. It should not
crack, or burst, but be soft all through. Just before
going to bed take the lemon (which should be very
hot), cut a piece from the top, and fill it with as much
white sugar as it will hold.</p>

<p>“Chock-full—do you mean?” asked an old gentleman
to whom I recommended the palatable remedy.</p>

<p>“If that is <i>very</i> full—pressed down, and running
over—I mean chock-full!” I replied.</p>

<p>Eat all the sugar, filling the lemon with more, as you
find it becoming acid.</p>

<p>This simple remedy induces gentle perspiration, besides
acting favorably upon the clogged membranes of
the throat. I have known it to prove wonderfully efficacious
in removing severe attacks of hoarseness.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Another,</span></h3>

<p>And far less pleasant prescription, is a teaspoonful of
vinegar made thick with common salt. Having myself
been, in earlier years, more than once the grateful
victim of its severely benevolent agency, I cannot but
endorse the dose.</p>

<p>But—try the lemon first.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">For Sore Throat.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>1 drachm chlorate of potassa dissolved in 1 cupful
of hot water.</p>

<p>Let it cool; take a table-spoonful three times a day,
and gargle with the same, every hour.</p>

<p>Before retiring at night, rub the outside of the
throat, especially the soft portions opposite the tonsils,
with a little cold water, made so thick with common
salt that the crystals will scratch the skin smartly.
Do this faithfully until there is a fair degree of external
irritation; then, bind a bit of flannel about the throat.</p>

<p>Free use of cracked or pounded ice is also admirable
for sore throat of every kind. The patient
should hold bits of ice in his mouth and let them slowly
dissolve.</p>

<p>Desperate cases of ulcerated sore throat are sometimes
relieved by the constant use of this and the
chlorate of potassa gargle.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">For a Cough.</span></h3>

<p>Eat slowly, three or four times a day, six lumps of
sugar, saturated with the very <i>best</i> whiskey you can get.</p>

<p>Having tested this “old woman’s prescription” for
myself, and found in it the messenger of healing to a
cough of several months’ standing which had set physicians
and cod-liver oil at defiance, I write it down
here without scruples or doubt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">For Cholera Symptoms,</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Summer complaint, or any of the numerous forms
of diseased bowels—pin a bandage of <i>red</i> flannel as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
tightly about the abdomen as is consistent with comfort,
having first heated it well at the fire or register.
The application is inexpressibly soothing to the racked
and inflamed intestines, and will, sometimes, combined
with perfect quiet on the part of the patient, and judicious
diet, cure even dysentery without medicine. Persons
who have chronic maladies of this class should
wear the red flannel bandage constantly.</p>

<p>For years, this has been my invariable treatment of
the disorders which are, particularly in the summer,
the torment of children and terror of mothers, and the
results have been most gratifying. I keep in what
may be called my “accident drawer,” red flannel,
divided into bandages of various lengths, and to these
is recourse had in slight, and even violent cases, instead
of to drugs. If the patient is suffering intense
pain, steep a flannel pad large enough to cover
the affected part, in <i>hot</i> spirits (you may add a little
laudanum in severe cases) and bind upon the abdomen
with the flannel bandage, renewing whenever the sufferer
feels that it is growing cold.</p>

<p>Above all things else, <i>keep the patient quiet</i> in bed,
if possible, but in a recumbent position—and the feet
warm with flannel or bottles of hot water. These are
always preferable to bricks, or hot boards for warming
the extremities, being clean, safe and good preservers
of heat.</p>

<p>The diet should be light and nourishing, avoiding
liquids and acids as much as possible. Let the patient
quench his thirst by holding small bits of ice in his
mouth, or, if he must drink, let him have mucilaginous
beverages, such as gum-arabic water. The burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
thirst consequent upon these diseases may be measurably
allayed by eating, very slowly, dry gum arabic,
which has, likewise, curative qualities.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mustard Plasters.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>It should be more generally known that a few drops
of sweet oil, or lard, rubbed lightly over the surface of
a mustard plaster, will prevent it from blistering the
skin. The patient may fearlessly wear it all night,
if he can bear the burning better than the pain it has
relieved temporarily, and be none the worse for the
application. This, <i>I know</i>, to be infallible, and those
who have felt the torture of a mustard-blister, should
rejoice to become acquainted with this easy and sure
preventive.</p>

<p>A mustard plaster is an excellent remedy for severe
and obstinate nausea. It must be applied, <i>hot</i>, to the
pit of the stomach. In less serious cases, flannel, dipped
in hot camphor, wrung out and applied, still smoking,
will often succeed. A drop of camphor in a single
teaspoonful of water, given every twenty minutes,
for an hour or so, is also a good palliative of nausea.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">For Nausea.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>But the specific for nausea, from whatever cause, is
<span class="smcap">Hosford’s Acid Phosphate</span>, a by no means unpleasant
medicine. Put twenty drops into a goblet of ice-water;
add a little sugar, and let the patient sip it, a teaspoonful,
at a time, every ten or fifteen minutes. Or,
where more active measures are required, give a drop
in a teaspoonful of water, every five minutes for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
hour. At the same time use the mustard plaster as
above directed.</p>

<p>My reader, to whatever “school” she may belong,
would not frown at what may seem to her like unlawful
dabbling in the mysteries of medicine, had she
stood with me beside the bed of a woman who had not
been able, for three days and nights, to retain a particle
of nourishment upon her stomach; who was pronounced
by physicians to be actually dying of nausea—and
seen her relieved of all dangerous symptoms,
within the hour, by the harmless palliative I have
named.</p>

<p><i>Inter nos</i>, sister mine, in the matter of drugs I am
heterodox, choosing, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred,
to trust dear old, Mother Nature, and skillful, intelligent
nursing. But to become a good nurse one
should possess some knowledge of Materia Medica,
especially in the matter of what are known as
“simples.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">For Chapped Hands and Lips.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>First, wash the hands with Indian, or oatmeal and
water, and wipe them <i>perfectly dry</i>. Then—do this
just before retiring for the night—rub the chapped
members well with melted—not hot-mutton-tallow,
“tried out” <i>pur et simple</i>, or beaten up, while warm,
with a little rose-water. Lubricate thoroughly; draw
a pair of old kid gloves—never black ones—upon
your hands, and do not remove them until morning.
A single application will usually effect a cure, but
should it fail, repeat the treatment for two or three
nights.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">For Sore Eyes.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>Beat up half a teaspoonful of powdered alum to a
curd with the white of an egg; spread upon soft linen,
and lay on the inflamed lid. It is a soothing, and often
potent remedy.</p>

<p>Strong tea, black, green, or mixed, strained and cold,
is an excellent eye-wash. At night, lay cold tea-leaves
within a soft linen bag, squeeze almost dry, and bind
over the eye.</p>

<p>For a stye, many physicians advise the sufferer to
take internally brewer’s yeast, a table-spoonful at a
dose. It is sometimes singularly successful, being a
good purifier of the blood.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mixture for Cleaning Black Cloth, or Worsted
Dresses.</span></h3>

<p>Equal quantities of strong black tea and alcohol.</p>

<p>Fine scented soap.</p>

<p>Dip a sponge in boiling water, squeeze as dry as you
can, and rub while hot, upon the sweet soap. Wet with
the mixture of tea and alcohol, and sponge the worsted
material to be cleaned, freely. Bub the spots hard,
washing out the sponge frequently in hot water, then
squeezing it. Finally, sponge off the whole surface of
the cloth quickly with the mixture, wiping always in
one direction if you are cleansing broadcloth.</p>

<p>Iron, while very damp, on the wrong side.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cleansing Cream.</span></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>1 ounce pure glycerine.</p>

<p>1 ounce ether.</p>

<p>1 ounce spirits of wine.</p>

<p>¼ pound best Castile soap.</p>

<p>¼ pound ammonia.</p>

<p>The soap must be scraped fine, the rest of the materials
worked into it.</p>

<p>To use it, wet a soft flannel cloth with it; rub grease
and dirt-spots upon worsted garments or black silk, until
the cloth is well impregnated with the cream. Then
sponge off with clean hot water, and rub dry with a
clean cloth.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Clean Marble.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>The pumice soap made by the Indexical Soap Manufacturing
Co., Boston, Mass., is the best preparation I
have ever used for removing dirt and stains from marble.
I have even extracted ink-spots with it. Wet a
soft flannel cloth, rub on the soap, then on the stain,
and wash the whole surface of mantel or slab with the
same, to take off dust, grease, etc. Wash off with fair
water, and rub dry. The polish of the marble is rather
improved than injured by the process. The same soap
is invaluable in a family for removing ink, fruit-stains,
and even paint from the hands. The makers of the
pumice soap, Robinson &amp; Co., are also the manufacturers
of the “silver soap,” for cleaning plate which
has nearly superseded all plate-powders, whiting, etc.,
formerly used for this purpose.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pumpkin Flour.</span> <img src="images/maltese_cross.jpg" width="13" height="13" alt="Maltese cross" /></h3>

<p>I remind myself, comically, while jotting down these
items of domestic practicalities, of the lucky chicken
of the brood, who, not content with having secured her
tit-bit of crumb, seed, or worm, noisily calls the attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
of all her sisters to the fact. I never secure even
a small prize in the housewifely line, but I am seized
with the desire to spread the knowledge of the same.</p>

<p>About three months ago, my very courteous and intelligent
grocer (I think sometimes, that nobody else
was ever blessed with such merchants of almost every
article needed for family use, as those with whom I
deal) handed me, for inspection, a small box of what
looked like yellow tooth-powder, and smelled like
vanilla and orris-root. It was pumpkin flour, he explained—the
genuine pumpkin, desiccated by the
“Alden process,” and ground very fine. I took it
home for the sake of the goodly smell, and because it
looked “nice.”</p>

<p>The pies made from it were delicious beyond all my
former experience in Thanksgiving desserts—a soft,
smooth, luscious custard, procured without cost of stewing,
straining, etc. And the flavor of them upon the
tongue fully justified the promise of the odor that had
bewitched me. It is seldom in a lifetime that one
finds a thing which looks “nice,” smells nicer, and
tastes nicest of all. If you, dearest and patientest
of readers, who never quarrel with my digressions, and
hearken indulgently to my rhodomontades, doubt now
whether I am in very earnest, try my pumpkin flour,
and bear witness with me to its excellence.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<h2>PARTING WORDS.<br />
————————</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Only</span> a few, lest the patience I have already had
occasion—and more than once—to praise, should fail at
the last pages. And if, in my desire to be brief, I
seem abrupt, you will understand that it is not because
I do not enjoy talking with, and at you.</p>

<p>Be honest with me! Have you ever, in studying
these two volumes which I have tried to make as little
dry as the subject would admit, whispered, or thought
something that implied a likeness between the author
and the anonymous gentleman, in whose garden—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 7em;">“The wild brier,</span></div>
<div class="verse">The thorn and the thistle grew higher and higher?”</div>
</div></div>

<p>I used to know Watts from title-page to “finis.” I
have taken pains to forget the creaking numbers of his
pious machinery of late years. But wasn’t the aforesaid
personage the one who “talked of eating and
drinking?” Have you ever said, ’twixt amusement
and impatience, “This woman thinks all women born
to be cooks, and nothing more?” As I look at the
matter of every-day and necessary duty—the routine
of common life—“common” meaning anything but vulgar—there
are certain things which <i>must</i> be learned,
whether one have a natural bias for them or no. All
men and women who would maintain a respectable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
position in this enlightened land at this day, must learn
how to read and write; must possess a fair knowledge
of the multiplication-table, have a tolerably correct impression
as to what hemisphere and zone they live in,
whether in a kingdom or republic; must be able to
describe the shape of the earth, and to tell who is the
President of the United States. Next to these, in my
opinion, stands the necessity that every woman should
know how to use her needle deftly, and have a practical
acquaintance with the leading principles of cookery.
The acquisition of these homely accomplishments can
never, in any circumstances, harm her. The probability
is, that she cannot perform her part aright as
spinster, wife, mother, or mistress without them.</p>

<p>I have a lovely child waiting for me on the “thither
shore,” whose many playful and earnest sayings are
still quoted by us in our family talks, quite as often
with smiles as with tears. Hers was a sunny life. We
knew that should the Father prolong her earthly existence
into womanhood, the power of <i>making</i> her happiness
would be no longer ours. But while our children
<i>were</i> children, to us belonged the precious prerogative
of flooding their hearts with delight, making of
home a haven of joy and peace they would never forget,
whatever the coming years might bring. Our
darling, then, was a happy, healthy child, and symmetrical
in mind as body—learning readily, and usually
with ease, the simple lessons suited to her years. Yet
at nine years of age, she said to me one night before
going to bed:</p>

<p>“Mamma, when I remember as I lay my head on
the pillow, every night, that I have to say the 9 column<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
of the multiplication-table to-morrow, I could
almost wish that I could die in my sleep, and the morning
never come!”</p>

<p>With my heart aching in the great pity I could ill-express
to one so young, I took her in my arms and
told her of the need she would have, in after-life, of the
knowledge gained so hardly; how, setting aside the
actual utility of the multiplication-table, she would be
better, wiser, stronger, always for the discipline of the
study.</p>

<p>She lived to laugh at the recollection of the fearful
bug-bear. Do I recall the incident with the least shade
of remorse that I did not yield to my compassion and
her pleading eyes, and remit, for good and all, the
dreaded exercise? On the contrary, I am thankful the
strength was given me to teach her how to battle and
to conquer. And—I say it in no irreverent spirit of
speculation—I have faith to believe that in the richer,
deeper life beyond, she still, in some way or sense, reaps
the good of that which she won by resolute labor, and
by the victory over her faint-heartedness.</p>

<p>I have thought of the little circumstance, a hundred
times, when women have bemoaned themselves, in my
hearing, over the hardship of being compelled to
“understand something about housekeeping.”</p>

<p>Since the “understanding” is a need, and patent
even to their unwilling eyes, what say Common Sense
and Duty?</p>

<p>My dear, I would not breathe it if there were a man
within possible hearing—but are you not sometimes
ashamed that women are content to know and to do so
little in this world?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span></p>

<p>“So are many men!” True, but that is the look-out
of masculine philanthropists—not ours. How many
ladies in your circle of acquaintances are willing—much
less eager to do anything, except the positive
and well-defined work laid upon them by custom and
society? How many enter into the full meaning, and
have any just appreciation of the beauty of the duties
especially appointed to <i>them</i>, of the glory and solemnity
of maternity, the high honor of being the custodians
of others’ happiness so long as life shall last;
God’s deputies upon earth in the work of training
immortal souls; of forming the characters and lives
that shall outlive the sun?</p>

<p>How many—to descend to a very plain and practical
question—could, if bereft of fortune to-morrow or next
week, or next year, earn a living for themselves, to say
nothing of their children?</p>

<p>I talked out this last-named question on paper, a few
months ago; threw arguments and conclusions into a
form which I hoped would prove more attractive to the
general reader, than a didactic essay. The last favor
I shall ask of you before closing this volume, is that
you will read my unpretending story through, and
answer to yourself, if not to me and the public, the
question put in the title.</p>

<h2>PRACTICAL—OR UTOPIAN?</h2>


<h3>PART I.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I am</span> going to think this matter out to a practical
issue, if it takes me all night!” said Mrs. Hiller, positively.
“It may be that I am rowing against wind
and tide, as you say, but I will hold to the oars until I
am hopelessly swamped, or reach land!”</p>

<p>Her husband laughed. Not sneeringly; but as good-natured
men always do laugh when women talk of
finding their way out of a labyrinth by means of the
clue of argument.</p>

<p>“You will accomplish no more than your conventions
and women’s rights books”—</p>

<p>“Don’t call them <i>mine!</i>” protested the wife.</p>

<p>“I speak of the sex at large, my love. No more,
then, than women’s rights books and conventions have
achieved. All their battle for the equality of the
sexes; the liberation of women from the necessity of
marriage as a means of livelihood; for more avenues
of remunerative labor, and the acknowledgment of the
dignity of the same—now that the smoke has cleared
away, and combatants and spectators can look about
them—is seen to have resulted in nothing, or next to
nothing. You have encouraged a few more women to
paint poor pictures, and spoil blocks and plates in attempts
to practise engraving; put some at bookkeepers’
desks where they are half paid; crowded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
board-rooms of our public schools with applicants at
the rate of a hundred for each vacancy; induced a
similar rush upon telegraph offices, and every other
place where ‘light, lady-like labor’ can be procured;
brought down, rather than raised the salaries in each
of these departments of industry—and made marriage
more than ever the <i>summum bonum</i> of every thinking
workwoman—the shining gate that is to give her liberation
from ill-requited toil.”</p>

<p>“Philip! how you exaggerate!”</p>

<p>“Not in the least, my dear, sanguine wife! Who
puts on her rose-colored spectacles whenever the subject
of ‘woman’s emancipation’ is brought forward. I
have studied this matter as closely as you have; hopefully,
for a while, but, of late, with the fast-growing
conviction that Nature and Society yoked are too
strong a team for you to pull against. Combat the assertion
as you will,—it is natural for a woman to look
forward to matrimony as her happiest destiny; to desire,
and to bring it about by every means which seems
to her consistent with modesty and self-respect. And
to this conclusion Society holds her by the refusal to
receive into the ‘best circles’ her who earns her living
by her own labor. Mrs. Million treads the charmed
arena by virtue of her husband’s wealth. But, when
Mrs. Sangpur is envious of her dear friend’s latest
turn-out in equipage, dress, or furniture, she recurs,
tauntingly, to the time when Mrs. Million was a work-girl
in Miss Fitwell’s establishment, and shrugs her
patrician shoulders over ‘new people.’ As Miss Fitwell’s
assistant, forewoman, and successor, Miss Bias—now
Mrs. Million—were she rich, refined, beautiful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
could yet never hope for a card even to one of Mrs.
Sangpur’s mass parties.”</p>

<p>“But there are distinctions of social degree, Philip,
which must be maintained. You don’t bring your
bootmaker home to dine with Judge Wright, or Honorable
Senator Rider.”</p>

<p>“I am not a reformer, my love. When my bootmaker
fits himself for the society of those you name,
he will be welcomed by them, and his early history
referred to as an honor, not disgrace. The annals of
Court and Congress will tell you this. To return to
the original question; I insist there is a want of practicalness—I
won’t say of common sense—in your reform,
as heretofore conducted; that no one woman in
five thousand, especially in what are called the higher
walks of life, is able to support herself, or would be
allowed by popular sentiment to do so, were she able.
There is a screw loose somewhere, and very loose at
that. I, for one, am never rid of the rattle. Maybe,
because I am the father of three daughters. If I had
sons, I should be condemned by the entire community;
stand convicted at the bar of my own conscience, if I
had not trained each of them to some trade or profession.
As it is, the case stands thus: I may live long
enough to accumulate a fair competency for each of
my girls, a sum, the interest of which will support her
comfortably; for she, being a woman, will never increase
the bulk of the principal. My more reasonable
hope is to see her married to an energetic business man,
or one who has inherited a fortune and knows how to
take care of it. This accomplished, parental responsibility
is supposed to end, so far as provision for the life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
that now is, goes. If her husband should fail, or die a
poor man—the Lord help her and her children—if I
cannot!”</p>

<p>He was not talking flippantly now. As he knocked
the ashes from the tip of his cigar into the grate, his
face was grave to sorrowfulness.</p>

<p>“Our girls have been carefully educated,” said Mrs.
Hiller, a little hurt at the turn the dialogue had taken.
“In this country a thorough education is a fortune.
They could set up a school.”</p>

<p>“To compete with a thousand others conducted by
those who have been trained expressly for this profession;
whom constant practice has made <i>au fait</i> to the
ever-changing modes of instruction and fashionable
text-books. Why, I, whose Latin salutatory was praised
as a model of classic composition, and who read Horace,
Sallust, and Livy in the original almost every day,
cannot understand more than half the quotations spouted
in the court-house and at lawyers’ dinners, by
youngsters who have learned the ‘continental method’
of pronunciation. I cannot even parse English, for the
very parts of speech are disguised under new names.
A noun-substantive is something else, an article is a
pronoun, and, what with adjuncts, subjects, and modifiers,
I stand abashed in the presence of a ten-year-old
in the primary department of a public school. Our
girls might go out as daily governesses at a dollar a
day, or run their chances of getting music scholars
away from professionals by offering lessons at half
price. They are good, intelligent, and industrious. I
don’t deny their ability to make a bare living, if forced
to do it. I don’t believe they could do more. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
the rainy day comes, He who tempers the wind to the
shorn lamb, must be their helper. Let us hope that
day will never dawn. And by way of additional provision
against it, I must leave you for an hour or two,
to keep an engagement with a client. Don’t let the
memory of our talk depress you. We won’t cross the
bridge before we come to it. Here is ‘Old Kensington’
to amuse you. You know, darling, that I would
work brains and fingers to nothing rather than have
you and the lassies want for so much as the ‘latest
thing’ in neck ribbons. And so would any man who
is worthy of the name.”</p>

<p>“I know <i>you</i> would.”</p>

<p>The elderly love-couple gazed into each other’s
eyes, exchanged a good-bye kiss as fondly as at their
partings twenty-three years before.</p>

<p>“I could ask no fairer destiny for my daughters
than has been mine,” murmured the mother, resettling
herself in her luxurious chair before the sea-coal fire,
and putting out her hand for the book the thoughtful
kindness of her husband had provided for her evening’s
entertainment. “But to every prize, there are so
many blanks! It is worse for a woman to sell herself
for a home and a livelihood than for her to fight, hand-to-hand
with poverty, all her life. If girls would only
believe this. I mean that mine <i>shall!</i>”</p>

<p>She did not open the book yet. Unrest and dissatisfaction
were in the face that studied the seething,
glowing pile in the grate.</p>

<p>“There are the Payne girls, for instance!” she said,
presently, with increasing discomfort.</p>

<p>The book lay, still shut, in her lap. She folded her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
hands upon it; lay back in the chair, and did not move
again in an hour. She was “thinking it out;” pulling:
hard on the oar in the teeth of head-wind and fog.</p>

<p>She was haunted by the Payne girls. Their father,
a popular physician, had lived handsomely; worked
hard; been exemplary in his home, his profession,
in church, and in city. He sent his five daughters
to the best schools, and fitted them by culture and
dress to make a creditable appearance in the world—the
only world they cared for—a round of visits, parties
and show-places for marriageable young people of
both sexes. They were nice girls, said complaisant
Everybody. Not beautiful, or gifted, but sprightly,
well-bred and amiable—the very material out of which
to make good wives and mothers. Two did marry before
the sad day on which their father was brought
home in an apoplectic fit, from which he never rallied.
They married for love, but not imprudently. Their
husbands were merchants with fair prospects, steady,
enterprising, moral young men, who were yet not quite
disposed to be burdened with the care of a maiden
sister-in-law-and-a-half apiece in addition to the support
of their families proper. That somebody would
have to “look after the unmarried daughters” was
soon bruited about. There were two boys—five and
ten years old—to be educated; the widow to be provided
for, and, when the estate was settled up, nothing
except a life-insurance of eighteen thousand dollars
was left with which to compass all this. Tenderhearted
Everybody was sorry for the fatherless boys;
sorrier for the widow, who had loved her husband very
truly; sorriest for “the Payne girls.” Before their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
mourning was rusty, appreciative Everybody began to
nudge Everybody Else slyly, when in company with
the Payne girls, to call attention to the fact, daily more
and more palpable, that the sisters three were anxious
to get married. Not more anxious, if the secrets of
feminine hearts had been revealed, than were dozens of
others in their set, but they had not the art to dissemble
their eagerness. Nobody stayed his, or her laugh at
them by considering that, since they had deliberately,
conscientiously, and humanely determined to relieve
their mother from the crushing weight of their dependence,
and saw no other way of doing this than by selling
themselves in the licensed and respectable shambles
of matrimony, they should have been commended for
doing with all their might whatsoever their hands found
to do. They angled earnestly, but with a zeal so little
according to knowledge that the most bull-headed gudgeon
in the preserved waters of bachelor and widowerdom
scorned to be imposed upon by the bait. They
borrowed the finery of their better-off sisters; made
their own and their mother’s over and over again; went
every where and tried every phase of fascination, “from
grave to gay, from lively to severe,” until their eager,
ceaseless smiles wore wrinkles about lips and eyes that
ill-natured Everybody called crows-feet, and the tales of
their fawnings, toadyisms, and manœuvres were stale in
the ears of greedy Everybody—yet were still, at thirty-six,
thirty-eight, and forty years of age, the Payne girls,
“whose brothers were now able to do something for
them.” What more suitable than that these fine young
fellows—one of whom had chosen his father’s profession,
while the other had gone into partnership with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
brother-in-law, should bind pillions upon their backs
whereon their sisters could ride in reputable indolence,
behind the wives they had wedded and had a right to
cherish?</p>

<p>“It was a pity,” considerate Everybody now began
to whisper, “that they should be thus hampered; but
what else could be done?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hiller’s fresh-colored, matronly face might well
be grave, as she recounted these things to herself,
had the history of the Payne girls been an isolated
case.</p>

<p>“But they are a type of so many!” she said, sadly.
“Society is encrusted with such, like barnacles sticking
to a ship. There is Lewis Carter, one of the ablest
young lawyers at the bar, Philip says. He and Annie
Morton have been in love with one another ever since
he was twenty-one, and she nineteen, ten years ago.
It is eight since his father died, and left him in charge
of his mother and three sisters, only one of whom is
younger than himself. They have not married, and,
until they do, he cannot. Annie may wait for him
until they are both fifty years old and upward—maybe
all their lives—for the older the sisters grow, the more
dependent they will become. They make a pleasant
home for him, people say; manage his money judiciously,
and fairly worship their benefactor. Yet he
must compare them, mentally, to leeches, when he
reflects how youth and hope are ebbing out of his
heart and Annie’s. No doubt leeches are sincerely
attached to what they feed upon. What right have
they to expect a support from him, more than he from
them? They are strong and well, and as much money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
was spent upon their education as upon his. Housekeepers,
forsooth! Does it take four women to keep
one man’s house?”</p>

<p>She was rowing very hard now, and the fog was
denser than ever.</p>

<p>“There is Mr. Sibthorpe, with his four girls and
three boys, and a salary, as bank-teller, of two thousand
dollars a year. The daughters all ‘took’ French and
music lessons at school. One of them is ‘passionately
fond’ of worsted work; another does decalcomanie
flower-pots and box-covers for fairs, and all crochet in
various stitches, and one is great upon tatting. They
‘help about house,’ as our grandmothers used to say,
all four of them; do contrive, with the aid of their
mother and a strapping Irish girl, to keep the housework
tolerably in hand, and ‘have in’ a dressmaker
and seamstress, spring and fall, to give them a fresh
start. They don’t read a book through once a year;
they have no connected plans about anything, except
to appear as well as girls whose fathers are worth ten
times as much as is theirs—and to get married! They
murder time by inches while waiting for the four
coming men; <i>mince</i> it into worthlessness with their
pitiful fal-lals of fancy work and the fine arts (save
the mark!). Evelyn told me, the other day, that the
sprig of wax hyacinths she showed me—a stiff, tasteless
spike, that smelled of oil and turpentine—‘occupied’
her for ten hours! What will become of them when
their pale, overworked father dies? It is frightful to
think of a vessel thus freighted and cumbered being
tied to safety by such a worn, frayed cord as that one
man’s life.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span></p>

<p>A dash of sleety rain against the window interrupted
her.</p>

<p>“Philip said there would be a storm before morning.
I wonder if he took his umbrella? He never
thinks of himself. I am sorry he had to go out at all
with such a cold.”</p>

<p>“One man’s life!” What flung the words back at
her? What had she and her petted daughters between
them and comparative—maybe absolute—poverty,
save the life of this man, who, with a heavy cold on
his lungs, had gone out into the fierce March night?
Who would dare prophesy that his dream of amassing
a competency for his children would be fulfilled?
Why should she be vexing her soul with speculations
about the Payne, and the Carter, and the Sibthorpe
girls, when other women, as wise and far-sighted as
she, were perhaps asking aloud, in friendly or impertinent
gossip over their respective firesides, what would
become of the “poor Hillers,” in the event of their
father’s death.</p>

<p>She felt very much as if her barque had, like Robinson
Crusoe’s ship,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“with a shock,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Struck plump on a rock!”</span></div>
</div></div>

<p class="unindent">What were <i>her</i> daughters good for, if the question
should arise how to keep the wolf from their own door?
There was Philip’s life-insurance (everybody insured his
life nowadays) of fifteen thousand dollars, secured to
herself; and this house in which they lived, the lowest
valuation of which was twenty thousand—and something—she
wasn’t sure how much besides. That is,
she supposed something would be left when all outstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
accounts were paid. Say, however, that they
would have thirty-five thousand clear. At six per cent.
interest, this would bring, she estimated, after a pause,
an income of twenty-one hundred dollars per annum.
Provided she sold the house! That was a pang, even
in imagination. Out of this sum must come rent, fuel,
clothes, and a thousand etceteras for a family of four
grown people, whose present income was, at the least,
ten thousand a year.</p>

<p>“Good Heavens!” The rosy face blanched even
under the ruddy rays of the sea-coal fire. “Say, then,
that we were worth fifty thousand dollars, free of incumbrance.
That would be only three thousand a
year; and, as Philip says, we could do nothing to increase
the principal. Why we would have to be economical,
if we had double that sum. And few men’s
estates yield more. How do widows and orphans who
have been reared in luxury, live, when the strong staff
is broken? I seem never to have understood until this
instant what helpless wretches women are; how most
helpless of all classes are those who know themselves,
and who have always been known as <i>ladies</i>, born and
bred. Is there a remedy, a preventive for this? Is it impracticable
to throw out an anchor to windward? What
was the origin of this insane, wicked, cruel prejudice
against independent thought and vigorous work on the
part of women, that fills every rank of life with miserable
wives, and mothers who ought never to be entrusted
with the care of children? Does He, who can make
even wickedness the instrument of His purposes, permit
this to flourish rank in Christian lands, that the world
may be lawfully populated?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>In the boat again, and in very deep, murky waters,
but tugging at the oar with all the energy of her practical,
common-sensible character.</p>

<p>“Philip says teaching does not pay any longer; nor
painting, nor music, nor fine sewing. What does?”</p>

<p>Through the smooth, oily heart of the big lump of
coal on the top of the mass in the grate, placed there
carefully by Mr. Hiller’s tongs before he went out, ran
a concealed layer of slate, not wider than a man’s finger,
nor thicker than a plate of mica. But when the fire
touched it, it cracked, and the big, justly-balanced lump
exploded with force that sent the fragments helter-skelter
in every direction.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hiller jumped up with a little scream, and shook
her dress violently, inspected every flounce, lest the
flutings might harbor a live coal or spark.</p>

<p>“All safe, fortunately,” she congratulated herself,
after brushing off rug and fender, and pushing her
chair a few paces further from the hearth. “It is a
real calamity to scorch a dress in this day, when one
pays so much for having it made. Our bills are absolutely
shameful. Whoever loses money, or fails to
make it, the milliners and dressmakers ought to be fat
and flourishing. Their profits must be enormous, yet
all of them—the competent and obliging ones—are
overrun with work. Madame Champe, for example,
gives herself the airs of a queen dispensing favors,
when she consents to undertake a dress for me.”</p>

<p>At that instant, with that tart speech, Mrs. Hiller
reached land and beached her boat.</p>

<p>The three girls did not return home from the party
to which they had gone until twelve o’clock. The rain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
had not touched them in the close coach their father
always hired for them on such occasions. Tossing off
their wrappings as they ran, they trooped into their
mother’s sitting-room, adjoining her chamber, where
she awaited them.</p>

<p>“With such a super<i>lu</i>gious home-sy fire! bright and
warm as her own heart,” chattered Blanche, the youngest,
rushing forward to throw herself on the rug at her
mother’s knee. “And a heavenly cup of tea! I enter
now into the full comprehension of the reason why it
is called the celestial herb,” sniffing the air. “There
never was, there never will be, there never <i>could</i> be,
such another mamma.”</p>

<p>“You are right there!” cried the others, kissing her
less noisily, but as fondly, as did the madcap of the
flock.</p>

<p>Any mother might be proud of the trio, clustered
about her, sipping the tea they declared to be more
delicious than all the delicacies of the supper table;
talking as fast as their nimble tongues could move of
what they had done, and seen, and heard, since she
had superintended their toilets, four hours before.
That the understanding between her and them was perfect,
hearty, and joyous, was plain.</p>

<p>Emma, the eldest, was twenty-one, tall, shapely, with
a complexion and gait that bespoke healthy nervous
organization, a sound mind and judgment. Her excellent
sense and happy temper made her a safe counsellor,
as well as agreeable companion, for her more
volatile sisters. She dressed tastefully, as did they
all; moved with composed grace through a systematic
round of daily duties; was her father’s pride, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
mother’s helper, and not a whit less popular in her
circle than if she had been both wit and beauty, whereas
she was neither.</p>

<p>Imogen was far handsomer, a decided blonde, while
Emma had gray eyes and dark hair. The second
daughter liked to set off her fairness by all justifiable
and lady-like appliances of art and fashion, and knew
how to do it. She was never florid or conspicuous in
appearance, yet never <i>en déshabille</i> in the simplest
attire. Her clothes became a part of her so soon as
she put them on. A few touches of her deft fingers
brought fitness out of disorder; added the nameless,
inestimable air we term “style,” for the want of a
fitter word, to whatever she touched or wore. A very
busy bee she was in her way, with a mania for renovating
her own paraphernalia and that of everybody
else who would allow her the privilege; giving to the
parlors, which were her especial charge, a new aspect
every day by the variety of her elegant devices.</p>

<p>Blanche—eighteen and just “out,” was <i>petite</i> in
figure, with light, fluffy hair, dancing blue eyes and
small white teeth that somehow made more arch her
merry smile. She was the pet and the mischief-maker
of the household, affectionate and frolicsome, with innumerable
tricksy, yet dainty ways that belonged only
to herself; quick of wit and fearless of tongue, and
facile in hand as Imogen, her room-mate and confederate
in all her schemes of pleasure or work.</p>

<p>“Emma lays the foundation; Imogen builds thereupon.
Mine is the ornamental department—the glossing
over and decking, after the scaffold is down,” she
had once said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>The mother recalled it, now, watching them as with
unsealed eyes, and was confirmed in the resolutions
which were the fruit of her evening’s musings.</p>

<p>“Away to bed, magpies!” she said, at length, “I
won’t hear a word more! You are warmed and refreshed
now. And unless you go soon, you will not
be down in season to recount your adventures and conquests
to papa at breakfast. He considers himself an
ill-used person when he has to go off without getting
the evening’s report. Moreover, I want you to have
your brains steady and clear, for I must have a long
business talk with you to-morrow forenoon.”</p>

<p>“Business! that sounds portentous,” said Imogen, in
affected consternation.</p>

<p>“It sounds entrancing!” commented Blanche. “It
savoreth of new dresses, and, perchance, jewelry—peradventure,
though <i>that</i> is a bold flight of fancy, of a
trip across the sea next summer.”</p>

<p>“Nothing has gone wrong, I hope, mother?” queried
Emma.</p>

<p>“Nothing at all, my dear Lady Thoughtful,” was the
smiling reply.</p>

<p>“Dear Lady Owl, you mean!” cried saucy Blanche,
and she went off singing:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“And what says the old gray owl?</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">To who? To who?”</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>“Happy children!” Mrs. Hiller heaved a confidential
sigh to the fire that had shone on the young faces a
moment ago. “Will what I have to tell them make
them less happy or gay? Is mine, after all, the needless
croak of the owl instead of a wise warning?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<p>The thought pierced her again, next day, when they
met in her boudoir, eager and curious, their eyes and
cheeks unmarred by the moderate dissipation of the
preceding night. But she stood fast to her purpose;
unfolded her scheme in bulk and detail, with the assured
tone of one who had considered the cost to the last
farthing. She was not accounted an eccentric woman
by her acquaintances, but her proposal was novel, and,
to her listeners, startling. Their days of school-study
were over, she reminded them. It was time that upon
the foundation of general information thus laid should
be erected the superstructure of a profession.</p>

<p>“A specialty, if you prefer the word,” she said;
“since I earnestly hope you will not be called upon to
practice it for a livelihood. While papa’s strength and
health last, he finds no more delightful use for his
earnings than to purchase comfort and luxury for us.
Were he to die, or to be unfortunate in business, or
become incurably diseased—and such things are of
almost daily occurrence—our style of living would be
at once and entirely altered. You would be driven to
the study of small, minute economies and false appearances,
such as must rasp and narrow the souls of those
who resort to them; to escape these by a marriage of
convenience, or the lucky accident of a love-match, or
to engage, in earnest, in some business that would,
thanks to your previous training, continue to you the
elegancies, with the decencies of life.”</p>

<p>This was the preamble to an abstract of the conversation
with her husband, the troubled reverie and calculations
that succeeded it.</p>

<p>“Of artists in music and painting, there are, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
twenty in this city,” she observed. “Of pretenders and
drudges in these arts, there are more than a thousand.
Since not one of you has developed any decided talent
for such pursuits, or for literature, and, since teaching
for a living has become but another name for bondage
and starvation, my plan is this: You, Emma, shall
learn bookkeeping; Imogen, dressmaking; Blanche,
millinery. Don’t look horrified! I shall not expose
you to the uncongenial associations or unwholesome
atmosphere of the crowded shop or work-room. All
that affection and money can do to make the term of
your novitiate pleasant shall be done. You shall fit up
the old nursery as your academy of the useful arts, if
you choose to call it by so dignified a name. I shall
engage competent instructors for you and pay well for
the lessons. But there must be no play-work, no superficial,
amateur performance on either side. When
your trades are learned, I shall expect you to keep
yourselves in practice, and up with the latest improvements
and fashions by practice in domestic manufactures.
Milliners’ and dressmakers’ bills shall be among
the things that were. Emma shall have charge of the
housekeeping accounts and papa’s books. He will pay
her as he would any other skilful accountant, and what
you, Imogen and Blanche, shall adjudge to be a reasonable
price for every dress and bonnet made for yourselves,
your sister, or for me.”</p>

<p>The, for once, dumb trio found simultaneous voice
at this.</p>

<p>“Mamma! would that be right? Would it not be
an imposition?”</p>

<p>“It is his own proposal. We talked it all over last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
night after he came home, and again this morning. I
need not tell you that he is the best, most indulgent
father that ever loved and spoiled three loving daughters.
I had some difficulty in persuading him to let
me try the experiment. The tears stood in his dear
eyes, while he debated the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> of the case.</p>

<p>“‘My bonnie bairns!’ he said. ‘If I could, I would
be their shield always. They should never dream of
privation; never ink or prick their pretty fingers except
for amusement, if I were sure of ten years more of life
and prosperity.’”</p>

<p>She stopped to steady her voice.</p>

<p>Imogen was crying outright; Emma’s gray eyes were
cloudy. Blanche broke forth, half-laughing, half-sobbing:—</p>

<p>“The angelic old papa! isn’t he a born seraph? I
would peddle rags with a lean mule, and a string of
bells across the cart, to save him an hour’s anxiety. I
wish <i>he</i> would wear French hats—all flowers and moonshine!
And have four every season. Would not I
furnish them for nothing, kisses thrown into the bargain?”</p>

<p>The others had to laugh at the vision of papa’s six
feet of stature, broad shoulders, strong features, and
iron-gray hair crowned with a fancy hat of the prevailing
mode. Mrs. Hiller went on:—</p>

<p>“‘But,’ he added, ‘I will not, while I can take care of
them, derive one cent’s profit from their work. There
is no surer way of learning how to take care of money
than having money to manage. I will furnish each of
the pusses with a bank-book. She shall make out
quarterly bills against you, or me; deposit her gains in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
her own name, and invest as she will. Her earnings
may thus be the nest-egg of a neat little fortune. I
can’t imagine—I won’t believe that they will ever become
mercenary. But I am sick of the limpness and
insipidity and general know-nothingness of the women
with whom I have business dealings. ‘My dear husband
never suffered me to be annoyed by these matters,’
says the widow, her handkerchief to her eyes. And—‘If
my poor papa had foreseen this day, it would have
embittered his life!’ sobs the interesting spinster of
forty-seven, who ‘hasn’t an idea how to make out a
checque,’ and really doesn’t know the difference between
real and personal estate!”</p>

<p>“The Payne girls!” uttered Imogen and Blanche, in
wicked glee. “Mamma, you ‘did’ Arethusa to the life.”</p>

<p>She resumed more seriously. “Something papa
heard last night caused us to lay this subject especially
to heart. Doctor Jaynes says there is no doubt that
Mr. Sibthorpe is threatened with softening of the
brain. He has been doing extra work this winter—bookkeeping
and copying in the evenings, at home, as
he could pick up such jobs, to eke out his salary, and
it has been too much for him. Nothing but absolute
rest and freedom from care can save him. Doctor
Jaynes told him so plainly, and he answered, with
tears, that it was out of the question—he must die in
harness. It was natural that the news should interest
and sadden us.”</p>

<p>“He has a very helpless family,” remarked Emma,
compassionately.</p>

<p>“Because so many of them—all who are grown up—are
girls!” cried Blanche, impetuously. “That tells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
the whole story. And such a pitiful, disgraceful, humiliating
one it is! I could be ashamed of being a
woman. Mrs. Sibthorpe—indeed a majority of American
mothers of the genteeler sort, ought to turn pagans,
and drown their baby-girls as soon as they are born.
That would be better than turning them loose—great,
overgrown babies, forever whining, with their fingers
in their mouths, over their feebleness, and timidity,
and sentimental ignorance—upon a grinning, or groaning
public!”</p>

<p>“But how strange that we have never taken this
subject into serious consideration before,” said sensible
Emma. “That other people do not, is certain. Mother,
you won’t mind if I ask you a question or two?”</p>

<p>“My precious child! as many as you like. I wish
you to state every objection frankly. You are of age,
you know. I could not compel you to adopt my suggestion,
if I were disposed to do so. Nor will I coerce
the judgment of one of you three. We must go into
this enterprise heartily and all together, or not at all.”</p>

<p>“Will not our action excite much talk when it is
known, give rise to unpleasant surmises, and subject
us to many impertinent inquiries?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly it will. We may as well prepare
ourselves for this. And the same kind guardians of
their neighbors’ behavior and general interests would
buzz and sting yet more industriously were one of us
to sicken with small-pox, or the house to burn down
to-morrow. Or, if papa were to go off in a rapid
consumption, they would bewail the number of girls
in our family as loudly and as delightedly as they will
soon be gossiping about poor, distraught Mr. Sibthorpe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
and his quartette of what Blanche calls overgrown
babies; would dole out to us such charity of word and
deed as falls to the share of the Payne girls. My
darlings, if I could tell you how I long to see you independent
of such changes in fortune and fair-weather
friends! each of you armed in herself to meet reverses
and to defy them, with <span class="smcap">God’s</span> help and blessing upon
those who are trying to help themselves!”</p>

<p>Whatever error the tender mother may have made
in her calculations of what was to be risked, gained,
and lost by the bold step she purposed, she had not
overrated the amount and quality of gossip caused by
the practical operation of her scheme. Stories, having
“Mrs. Hiller’s queer whim” for a starting-point, increased
and multiplied, and flew over the town like
thistle-down in a windy September day. The mother
was a tyrant; the daughters were peculiar and strong-minded.
The parents refused to maintain their offspring
because they were not sons, and had informed
them of their intention to bequeath every dollar of
their property to a Boys’ Orphan Asylum. The offspring
disdained to be fed and clothed by the hated
parents. Mr. Hiller was insolvent; Mrs. Hiller was
insane; both were misers. The sisters were engaged
to be married to missionaries, and were bent upon engrafting
the multifarious iniquities of the modern and
Christian woman’s garb upon the scantily-clothed
trunk of Ashantee, or Papuyan, or Root-digger fashions.</p>

<p>At first our heroines were annoyed, then diverted.
In less than three months they ceased to think of the
babble at all, in their growing interest in their active,
varied home-life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>

<p>Just a year from the March night on which Mrs.
Hiller had used so many nautical figures in her speech
and reverie, two cards were brought up to the “academy
of useful arts,” as the fair students therein persisted
in calling a large room at the back of the house.
It was airy and sunny, and, to-day, was full of life and
enjoyment, for mother and daughters were gathered
there, and the chirping was like that of a happily-crowded
robin’s nest.</p>

<p>“The ladies say, <i>do</i> let ’em run right up, without
ceremony,” reported the servant.</p>

<p>“‘Arethusa Payne,’ and ‘Marietta Sibthorpe,’” read
Blanche from the cards. “Ask them to walk up to the
work-room, Jane. Mind that you say ‘the work-room.’”
As the amused girl left the chamber, the young lady
continued: “An Inspection Committee! Let them
come! Won’t I make them open their eyes, though?”</p>

<p>“I had no idea you were engaged with a dressmaker.
I am afraid we intrude,” simpered Miss Payne, tiptoeing,
like a cautious hen, between Blanche’s work-stand,
piled with bonnet frames and linings, and
Imogen’s, down which flowed a river of silken flounces,
half gathered at the top; noting likewise, by turning
her sharp face to the right, then the left, as she stepped
(still like an inquisitive Partlet), that Emma’s tall
desk, with a ledger open upon it, was in a corner.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hiller was ripping up a black silk dress;
Emma was pulling a velvet hat to pieces.</p>

<p>“Only practising our trades a little in furbishing up
things; giving a spring-ish look to hats and gowns,”
rejoined Blanche, with saucy politeness. “One gets so
sick of winter clothes!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dear me, how convenient! What a source of
amusement it must be to have that sort of knack!”
said Miss Sibthorpe, self-compassionately. “It is a
genuine talent, isn’t it now? downright genius! And
can you actually <i>make</i> a hat, Blanche! I couldn’t put
a bit of ribbon on mine to save my life!”</p>

<p>“But we are professionals,” put in Imogen. “You
have no idea how we have worked to acquire the artistic
touch. We had Miss Tiptop’s forewoman with us at
the country cottage we rented last summer, all the
‘dull season,’ on purpose to teach me dressmaking,
besides the lessons I had had in town. Blanche ran
down to the city every week for an all-day lesson.”</p>

<p>“But how very odd!” ejaculated Arethusa.</p>

<p>“That people should pay such exorbitant milliners’
bills all their lives, when they could learn the business
with one-fourth the labor and in one-tenth of the time
music requires?” Blanche said, in wilful misunderstanding,
setting her head on one side, and holding her
unfinished hat off at arm’s length to examine the effect.
“It is queer, as you say. I’ll be generous, girls. I’ll
<i>give</i> you instructions, if you wish—take you as my apprentices.
I should enjoy it hugely.”</p>

<p>Both laughed shrilly and affectedly, to disguise the
offence her proposal gave them.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least taste for such employment,” said
Arethusa.</p>

<p>“You are very kind, but my social engagements are
<i>so</i> numerous!” pleaded Marietta. “Honestly, what
do you do it for? You can’t really like it! It seems
so—so—very peculiar! such a queer whim, you know!”</p>

<p>“That is just what everybody says—such a queer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
whim! You get so much talked about, you know,”
subjoined Arethusa. “And it is <i>so</i> excessively disagreeable
to be talked about! I couldn’t stand it.”</p>

<p>“But you do not understand,” pursued Blanche,
solemnly, “that you might make a living by it. Why,
we three expect to be a rich firm in the course of time;
to buy up bank stock and railway shares, and speculate
in real estate, and all that. Emma is a capital book-keeper.
Papa says she could command a salary of a
thousand dollars a year already. Then, think of the
luxury of having a new dress, or, what is the same
thing, one that is made over to look like new, at every
party; and as many hats a season as you want, for
what it would cost to buy one at Madame Lavigne’s.
And finally, you see, one respects herself so thoroughly
and deliciously for being able to fill up a real place—a
worker’s place—in the world. Most women remind me
of marbles that have rolled somehow into holes. Sometimes
it is a fit. But as often as not the marble is
round, and the hole is square!”</p>


<h3>PART II.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">All</span> aboard!”</p>

<p>As the cars glided out of the lighted depot into the
darker streets, leading to the utter gloom of the open
country, two gentlemen settled themselves into their
seats with audible sighs of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Homeward bound!” said the elder, a man of fifty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
hale in figure and face, although his hair was almost
white.</p>

<p>“For which let us be thankful!” responded his companion,
heartily. “This has been a long week to me,
although a busy one—longer than a fortnight would
have been at home.”</p>

<p>“You may blame the twin babies for that,” said the
other, smiling indulgently at his impatience.</p>

<p>“<i>Bless</i> them for it, you mean—the boys and their
mother. A man may well be impatient to get back to
such treasures as are mine.”</p>

<p>He was a fine-looking fellow, manly in every gesture
and tone, six-and-twenty years old, the son-in-law of
the gentleman beside him, and had been for a year his
law-partner.</p>

<p>“You are right. Emma is a good girl—a noble
woman; her mother’s own daughter for sense, discretion,
and warmth of heart. There is nothing frivolous
or shallow about her. Let me see—the boys are almost
three months old, are they not?”</p>

<p>“Just three months to-morrow. It is marvellous
what strength the thought of them puts into my heart
and arm. The cunning little rascals! Emma writes
that they grow every day. She is sure they will recognize
me on my return. I suppose you experienced
papas, who have outlived the novelty of this sort of
thing, amuse yourselves vastly at our expense; but it
pleases me to believe what she says. They are very
bright, healthy in mind and body, as the children of
such a mother should be. They and I are blest beyond
comparison in having her for the angel in our house.
Should it please <span class="smcap">God</span> to spare our lives”—<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>

<p>The sentence rested on the shocked air, incomplete,
never to be finished. One terrific jar!—a crashing
and splintering, and reeling, an awful sense of falling
down, down, through utter darkness, over and over,
then a blow that ended everything—surprise, consternation,
fearful questioning—in blank, black silence.</p>

<p>When the débris of the telescoped cars was cleared
away, the two men were found lying, as they had sat, side
by side. The younger was dead. The elder moved and
groaned as he was lifted from the wreck. Papers upon
their persons established their identity beyond a doubt.</p>

<p>Early next morning a telegram was brought into
a pretty dressing-room, where the sunshine, peering
through the vine-leaves about the window,
made dancing shadows on the floor, laughed, and
leaped, and flashed in reflection from the water in a
China bath, set in the middle of the chamber. In this
splashed and crowed two baby-boys, one held by the
mother, the other by the grandmother, and between
these knelt two younger women—all four in delighted
worship of the tiny cherubs. There was a breathless
hush as the youngest of the party sprang up to seize
the envelope, and tore it open.</p>

<p>“<i>Collision!</i>” said the missive. “<i>Frederick Corwin
killed instantly. Philip Hiller badly injured.
Both will be sent on in next train.</i>”</p>

<p>In this ghastly shape came disaster to the long-exempt
household. Life and the world had dealt so benignly
and bountifully with them heretofore, that they
had insensibly learned to look upon their possession of
health, love, and happiness as assured for years and years
to come. Emma’s marriage had removed her from them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
but a couple of blocks, and all concurred in the opinion
that this was a charming variety upon their former estate.</p>

<p>“How did we ever get along without Fred’s and
Emma’s house to run into? It is as good as having
two homes,” the girls often said among themselves.</p>

<p>When the twins came—bouncing, healthy boys—the
excitement and joy in one house equalled that in
the other. It seemed now, indeed, that they could ask
nothing more of Heaven; that the brimming cup of
bliss was mantled all over with rose-leaves. And when
“Papa and Fred” were obliged to be absent from
their homes for a week, in attendance upon the doings
of a court a hundred miles away, Emma and her babes
were transferred with much ceremony and rejoicing to
her mother’s care; given up to the petting and admiration
of the doating aunties without reservation, beyond
Fred’s earnest entreaty that they would not kiss the
boys away to skeletons before he returned, and a threat
to have them protected by copper sheathing from the
fate of St. Peter’s brazen toe.</p>

<p>Dear Fred! the merry, handsome, stalwart brother;
their only one,—who was never to jest with them again;
never again to hold wife and babes in his embrace.
Imogen and Blanche mourned for him only less passionately
than did she who had proudly and gladly
borne his name. Poor wife! she was denied the satisfaction
of hearing that her name had been the last in
his thoughts and speech; that the loyal heart had
never beat more lovingly for her than in its latest
throbbings; for weeks passed before Mr. Hiller
could speak at all, and then the disjointed utterances
of the palsied tongue told nothing beyond the terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
fact that the brain had sustained serious, it might be
irreparable, damage. A paralytic cripple he would
remain until the day of his death, although this half-life
might be prolonged for years, pronounced the best medical
authorities in the land, summoned without regard
to distance or expense, by the agonized wife.</p>

<p>Stricken, smitten of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and afflicted, the four women
sat them down together in the mother’s room, a
month after the double bereavement, and took mournful
but deliberate counsel together. Their affairs were
not at a desperate pass, as they already knew. There
was the house in which they lived, free of mortgage,
which would bring at least thirty thousand dollars in
the market; ten thousand dollars in bank stocks and
other securities—solid, paying investments, and five
thousand dollars’ worth of real estate—chiefly unimproved
lots in a growing part of the city, that might be
very valuable in time, if they could be held and the
taxes paid. Fred had invested four thousand dollars
in the latter kind of property, and his life was insured
for ten thousand more. If Emma were to sell everything—furniture,
lots and all—she would have just
seventeen thousand dollars with which to support herself,
to rear and educate her boys. By living upon the
interest of the life-insurance fund, and paying taxes on
the real-estate for some years, she might double the little
fortune bequeathed to her, without reserve, by her
husband’s will.</p>

<p>“I shall not touch a cent of it, if I can help it,” she
said, in sad decision. “It shall be the father’s provision
for his sons. They will need it all, in order to educate
themselves as he would have wished. For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
present I shall work for them and myself. You foresaw
this years ago, mother. I thank <span class="smcap">God</span>, and thank
you, that you prepared us to meet it!”</p>

<p>“Amen!” said her sisters fervently. “Dark as is
the day—so much darker than we ever dreamed it
would be,” added Imogen, tearfully, yet trying to
smile, “we have much to be thankful for. We are
strong; we know how to work; and there are papa
and the babies, darling Fred’s sons, to work for.”</p>

<p>“Papa and the babies!” Even the fond wife did
not resent the classification. The hale gentleman
whose half-century of honest, temperate life had not
bowed his head or dimmed his eye; the sage, shrewd
man of business, than whom none were more respected
by his fellow-citizens, was a tremulous, timid child,
who wept if his meals were delayed one minute, or his
wife, his faithful, tender nurse, were out of his sight
for an hour.</p>

<p>“Utterly incapable of attending to the simplest matters
connected with his business!” cried open-eyed
Everybody, hovering, harpy-like, about the human
wreck. “Why, he couldn’t count one hundred to
save his life. Of course, they will get a certificate of
lunacy from the court, and sell the house, lots, and
whatever they can realize anything upon; put
all they have together, and live as prudently as
possible. The girls ought to marry before long.
They are pretty and popular, in spite of their little
eccentricities. It isn’t to be expected that they will
make brilliant matches now, of course; but they must
bring down their ambition to a reasonable level. Beggars
mustn’t be choosers. It is unfortunate that poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
Mrs. Corwin has those two children. But they may
not live. Twins are more likely to die than other
babies. And, if they <i>should</i> be taken, she’ll be likely
to pick up another husband. Her little property would
be a consideration to some men.”</p>

<p>Even the true friends of the sorely-tried family
wished sincerely and aloud that “each of the dear girls
had a husband to take care of her;” recommended
them warmly to the compassionate and favorable notice
of their bachelor acquaintances, and devised pious
plans of matchmaking for their relief from the inconveniences
of their altered circumstances.</p>

<p>“The worst part of it all was that poor Emma was
encumbered with the children, who would be more and
more expensive every year, and that poor, dear Mr.
Hiller would be a helpless imbecile all his life. And
what a mistake in them to refuse to treat him as such,
and have him examined by a commission who would
give his family the right to dispose of his property!”</p>

<p>If the Ruler of the intellects and lives of men had
hearkened to these benevolent economists, the crippled
man and the brace of “unfortunate” infants would
have been taken speedily and comfortably out of this
present evil world.</p>

<p>“Thank heaven for the babies!” uttered Blanche,
throwing her arms about Emma’s waist. “You darling
sister! I bless you for them every hour. What
should we have done through all these last fearful
weeks without them—and you? Touch their weeny
teenty patrimony! Indeed you shall not! And more
than that, we’ll make it a big one by the time they are
ready to enter college.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>The mother, as chief counsellor, had her plan ready
for their consideration. The house—a large double
one—was still to be occupied by them. The front parlor
was to be used for the millinery department, and
put entirely under Blanche’s care. In the back, Imogen
would hold sway; and a smaller apartment in the rear
of the hall should be the fitting and trying-on chamber.
The library across the hall, adjoining the dining-room,
was to be the family parlor. In every other part of the
house things were to remain unchanged.</p>

<p>“Who deserves to live more comfortably and luxuriously,
to rest in soft chairs and sleep upon elastic mattresses,
to have generous food served elegantly to tempt
the appetite and strengthen the body, than she who purchases
all these with her own toil?” said the strange
logician whose daughters were too used to her “queer
notions” to be startled by them. “I do not say that you
will make money fast, or at once. I do contend that,
saving rent, bookkeeper’s and saleswoman’s wages, as
you will do, you ought to be able to clear your business
and personal expenses the first year—if nothing
more.”</p>

<p>“If the customers come,” suggested Emma.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hiller nodded confidently. “They will come!
In the beginning, out of curiosity and the love of novelty.
It will depend upon your skill whether they
continue their custom.”</p>

<p>All previous sensations respecting the Hillers—their
odd fancies and daring talk and levelling theories;
Emma’s marriage and the birth of her twins; the tragical
death of her husband and Mr. Hiller’s deplorable
condition—faded into the realms of forgottenness before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
that excited by the appearance in all the leading
papers, the following month, of an advertisement to
the effect that the “Misses Hiller would open on Tuesday,
the 15th instant, at their father’s residence on
Lofty Avenue, a first-class millinery and dressmaking
establishment, and pledged themselves to use their
best efforts to give satisfaction to their customers.”</p>

<p>The sudden intrusion of a bee-moth into a well-regulated,
honey-lined hive might create such commotion
among the inhabitants thereof as prevailed in the
“best circles” of the city when the Incredible was, at
length, developed by means of printer’s ink and paper,
into the Certain. The Hiller philosophy had wrought
its legitimate fruits, said the wise ones. Such sympathy
with the lower classes, and familiarity with their modes
of thought and personal history, amounting to fanatical
imitation of their language and habits and mercenary
views of life; such bold scoffing at the ethics and
usages of SOCIETY (this in capitals half an inch long,
if you please, Mr. Printer!) could have but one sequel,
and that a catastrophe.</p>

<p>“Be it so!” enunciated resigned Everybody, in the
calm of sinless despair. “Since the Hiller girls prefer
to sink to the level of mere working women; to fly in
the face of Providence that would, if they were more
reasonable and less sentimental, endow them with
property to the amount of at least fifty thousand dollars—sixty
thousand, if poor Mrs. Corwin’s be included,
with the certain prospect of fifteen thousand more at
poor Mr. Hiller’s death—if they prefer, instead of
taking the goods thus offered them and living like
ladies in the sphere to which they were born, faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
to the principles that control refined SOCIETY—to
delve and plan and accumulate, let them be recognized
forthwith as <i>laborers</i>—nothing more, and nothing
less! We, the loyal leaguers of SOCIETY, true to
the traditions of our class and age, cannot more effectually
and dignifiedly exclude them from our sacred
circle than by patronizing and <i>paying</i> them <i>as</i> dressmakers
and milliners. They have exquisite taste.
That we, being candid even where our enemies
are concerned, will admit. They have also, tact and
energy, and association with US in the past has given
them just ideas of our style and needs. While we do
not budge an inch from our belief and precept that
they should have starved genteelly; lived on bread and
tea, dyed and turned and otherwise rejuvenated their
friends’ cast-off dresses; shivered over pinched-in grates
in winter and sponged upon obliging acquaintances in
summer—sooner than thus degrade themselves and
betray their caste for the sake of pampering their flesh
with the delicacies of the markets, and their pride by
indulging in purple and fine linen, in damask and cut-glass,
in Brussels and satin—we”—concluded breathless
Everybody, “accept the situation as they have set
it before us.”</p>

<p>“But it is suicidal!” actually sobbed the well-wishers
of the recalcitrant trio. “<i>They will never marry well
now!</i>”</p>

<p>“Tuesday the 15th inst.” arrived—sharp but clear
November weather, and the desecrated Hiller mansion
wore its most cheerful aspect. In the back parlor the
decks had been cleared for action, as Imogen phrased
it, by removing the piano, a large sofa, and an inlaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
stand or two. Imogen’s sewing machine and chair
were by the side window. Before the embayed recess
at the end of the room was a long, rather narrow table
of singular construction, the plan being her own. The
top was covered with enamelled leather, with morocco
pouches at each corner, rather larger than the pockets
of a billiard-table, and deep drawers underneath. A
tape-measure and a case of scissors lay upon this. The
pictures on the walls; the carpets; the rich hangings
of the windows; the lounging-chairs set invitingly
about, the easel, with its collection of fine engravings
in one corner, a <i>chiffonier</i> loaded with attractive articles
of virtu, and a few fresh, attractive books—even the
stand of flowers in the bay-window were the same that
had so often challenged the admiration of Mrs. Hiller’s
guests, as giving her parlors “<i>such</i> an air of home-like
elegance.”</p>

<p>In Blanche’s realm there had been more and material
alterations. In the niches on each side of the
mantel were tall, shallow cases, with sliding glass doors.
These were made of black walnut, and bright silver-plated
knobs and pegs set in the back. Beneath the
doors were drawers with handles of the same metal.
An attractive array of bonnets and hats hung in one
case; of caps, and headdresses and wreaths, bouquets,
sprays of flowers in the other, these last apparently
springing from a box filled with moss set in the bottom.
Opposite the mock conservatory was a show-case, being
a walnut table handsomely carved, with a glass box on
top containing ribbons arranged with a nice regard to
harmony and contrasts of colors and shades. This also
had drawers beneath with silver knobs. At one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
front windows stood Blanche’s chair and wicker-work
stand. Hanging-baskets of living flowers swung between
the curtains; a mocking-bird’s cage in the arch
dividing the rooms.</p>

<p>Emma was walking slowly up and down the length
of the two apartments, ready to retire, at the approach
of customers, to her desk in the fitting-room. Her
sisters had insisted upon her right to seclude herself
from general observation.</p>

<p>“We don’t mind being made a show of! In fact,
we rather like it!” the irrepressible Blanche was saying.
“But they sha’n’t come to stare at, and whisper
about you, Queenie!”</p>

<p>Her eyes sparkled; her cheeks were red as the
French poppies in the glass case near by. Every crimp
in her blonde hair seemed to stir in the breeze of excitement
that swept and swayed her merry spirit. She
flitted about from Imogen’s dominion to her own,
altering, admiring, exclaiming, like a restless humming-bird.</p>

<p>“I am sorry for you, too,” she ran on, “for I anticipate
great fun during the next few weeks. All the
calls to-day that are not prompted by curiosity, more
or less ill-natured, will be of condolence. Don’t I
know how our dear friends will pull out eye-glass and
handkerchief in the same tug. ‘You poor, dear girls!’
Mrs. Smith will sniff. (No matter what happens to
you, whether you lose a front tooth, or your fortune,
or your life, your best wishers will call you ‘poor dear!‘)
‘Now <i>do</i> you think—honestly, now, you know—that it
was <i>really</i> necessary for Philip Hiller’s daughters to
take this un<i>pre</i>cedented step?’”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>“Miss Allfriend will kiss us all around, and drop a
tear on each of our noses, with—‘My <i>dear</i> children!
it makes my heart bleed! And <i>how</i> does mamma
stand it?’ And Mrs. Williams will trot in, eye-glass
up—‘Bless me! bless me! I thought I should drop
when I read it in the papers! Such a shock! You can’t
really conceive! Bromide and red lavender all night,
my dears! I assure you!’”</p>

<p>“Hold your saucy tongue!” laughed Imogen, in
spite of herself, and even Emma smiled at the spirited
mimicry.</p>

<p>Blanche rattled away faster than ever. “I am going
to be prim and proper when they begin to come! One
and all will criticise our appointments as ‘shockingly
extravagant;’ declare that ‘the like was never seen
before in store or work-room—quite out of keeping,
you know!’ and prophesy swift ruin if we keep on as
we have begun. And we won’t hint that we paid for
everything, our very own selves, with the money papa
has forced upon us for the work we have done in the
last four years. It’s none of their business! nor that
we have some left, to repair losses, should we have any!”</p>

<p>“Dear papa! all we can do won’t bring back health
and reason to him!” sighed Emma. “Or life to”—</p>

<p>Her eyes filled suddenly, and she would have
hastened from the room, but Imogen caught her in her
arms.</p>

<p>“For <i>their</i> sakes—those who loved and believed in
us—and for the babies; we will acquit ourselves
bravely, sister. There are times when work that we
must do—systematic and sustained effort for others, is
<span class="smcap">God’s</span> best cure for soul-morbidness. <i>I</i> know!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span></p>

<p>The others exchanged a silent look over the bright
head bowed on Emma’s shoulder—a glance of blended
pity and indignation. Then, Blanche pulled back the
glass door of her flower-case with needless rattle, and
busied herself with a pendant of glossy ivy.</p>

<p>“Another year I will devise some such plan as this
for showing off my feathers—something like an aviary—see
if I don’t!”</p>

<p>Not one of the three ever referred, in so many words,
to the fact that handsome, accomplished Harding Walford
had not entered the house in more than a month;
that his visits had slackened perceptibly in frequency
and length since it became generally known that Mr.
Hiller would never recover. He had been Imogen’s
most devoted attendant for almost a year. Her family
had not doubted what would be her answer to the declaration
they saw was pending. The world reported
that he had broken a positive engagement, and ran no
risk in so doing, since she had neither father nor brother
to defend her rights. But there was not, on this account,
meted out to him a formidable share of censure.
He was “the best judge of his own affairs.” He was
not rich. Had he been, he might still, with reason,
hesitate to take a step that would entail upon him such
a weight of responsibility as would a connection with
the no longer prosperous Hillers, even had not Imogen’s
eccentric conduct of late, in banding with her sisters
“to undermine the distinctions of SOCIETY,” been
ample excuse for his defection. He was wise in his
generation, and the applause showered upon him who
doeth good unto himself, was his due. SOCIETY
always pays this sort of debt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p>Only—Imogen had believed in him; and the shivering
of her trust beyond the hope of repair, was very
hard to bear. So much more cruel than the thought
of being the target of gossip’s shafts, that the latter
rattled unheeded against her armor of proud rectitude
that day, and ever afterward. Desertion had stung its
worst when the man she loved had looked for the last
time, with love-full eyes, into hers.</p>

<p>Customers did come; singly, in twos and threes,
and, a little past midday, when they had discussed
the Hillers’ affairs comfortably over their luncheon-tables,
in droves. They gathered in the spacious
rooms, as Mrs. Hiller had predicted, not so much to
buy or order, as to criticise and wonder. The most
comic part of the exhibition to fun-loving, dauntless
Blanche was that so many were disconcerted at finding
that they were not singular in their curiosity
and the resolve to gratify it. Hardly second to this
was the ludicrous uncertainty on the part of most of
the visitors as to the proper line of conduct to be pursued
in greeting the gentlewomen so abruptly transformed
into trades-people whom they were here to
scrutinize. That the cordial yet respectful familiarity
of equals was not to be thought of, now, was the dominant
impression with the majority. Yet few were so
indurated in worldliness, or so barefaced in the display
of it as to attempt to treat their late social compeers
exactly as they would “quite common persons.” The
result was a combination of stiffness and patronage
totally at variance with the carriage of well-bred ease,
flavored with hauteur, they adjudged to be “the thing
in the circumstances.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<p>The proprietors of the elegant apartments were mistresses
of themselves and the position from the beginning.
With a single eye to business, they adroitly
evaded all allusion to the novelty of the scene; received
the compliments to their establishments and
their wares with smiling composure; showed the stock
and took orders with professional dexterity, and entirely
ignored glances and veiled hints of commiseration.</p>

<p>“Have you <i>no</i> assistants?” queried more than one.</p>

<p>“At present, none,” Imogen returned, quietly.
“Should our business require it, we shall procure help,
keeping everything, of course, under our own personal
supervision.”</p>

<p>“It is not an untried field to us, you know,” subjoined
Blanche, in her blithest tone. “Much practice
has taught us swiftness and the artistic sleight of hand
that distinguishes the work of the <i>modiste</i> from that
of the amateur.”</p>

<p>The rooms were quite full when a plain but handsome
carriage stopped at the door. A lady alighted
with her arms full of bundles, followed by two slender
girls of eighteen and twenty, each with a parcel, although
the footman stood idly by, holding the door.</p>

<p>“Just like her!” murmured a spectator inside the
front window, peeping through the lace curtains.
“She prides herself on her want of what she calls
false shame, and on being able to wait on herself.”</p>

<p>A hum ran from the tattler through the little assembly.
Blanche, who was showing a box of feathers to a customer,
feigned not to hear it; dared not to steal a look
at her sister, although she longed to know how she comported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
herself in view of the approaching ordeal. She
was the only one present whose eyes were not directed
instantly toward the young dressmaker as she advanced
a few steps to meet the new arrivals. Foremost in the
group was the mistress of the carriage, a stately figure,
richly attired, who wore her own gray hair folded
smoothly above a pair of black brows and searching,
usually severe eyes. They softened and shone at sight
of the form in deep mourning, awaiting her pleasure,
perhaps reading through the guise of lady-like self-possession
the secret trouble that fluttered heart and
pulse, while the trained features served the resolute
will faithfully.</p>

<p>“My dear child!” she said, impulsively, holding
fast to her parcels, but bending to kiss the cheek which
flushed high under the salute.</p>

<p>Her daughters pressed forward to bestow caresses as
affectionate upon “dear Imogen,” the family having
recently returned from abroad. Their mother allowed
them no time for inquiries or condolence.</p>

<p>“I am very, very glad to see you looking so well and
bright!” she pursued, in a breezy, cheerful tone, neither
shrill nor loud, but one that could make itself
heard whenever and by whomsoever she willed. “I
didn’t mean that my first call should be one of business,
but I suppose you wouldn’t admit me upon any other
plea, in business hours. But there’s the great Huntley
wedding, week after next, you know, and the girls
haven’t enough finery to warrant their appearance
there—just from Paris, too! So we have come to cast
ourselves upon your generosity and beg you, for the
sake of old times and present friendship, to make us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
presentable. Unless you are too severely taxed already
by the importunate friends of whom I see so many
present. How is the dear father to-day? You must
let me see him and mamma before I leave—and
Emma and the babies! You mustn’t exclude us from
the other parts of the house because you have taken to
practicalities in sober, serious earnest. We would rebel
outright, and <i>en masse</i>—after having been welcomed,
during so many years, to the pleasantest home
in the city!”</p>

<p>Imogen had led the way into the other parlor while
the lady talked, and was now undoing the wrappings
of the three silk dresses, and opening boxes of rare,
fine lace on the long table. Her back was to the
groups of attentive listeners to the foregoing monologue,
and the keen eyes beside her saw her fingers shake, the
long, brown lashes fall quickly to hide the unshed
tears.</p>

<p>“You are <i>very</i> good!” said a gentle, grateful voice.
“But I felt sure you would be!”</p>

<p>“My love!” A strong and not small hand—ungloved—a
superb diamond <i>solitaire</i>, in itself a fortune,
flashing on it as the guard to a worn wedding-ring—covered
the chill, uncertain fingers, busy with paper
and twine. Imogen felt the warmth and thrill of the
pressure to her very heart. “If you ever dare to say
another word like that, I’ll never forgive you! Trimmings,
style, everything—we leave to you, Imogen, my
dear!” she continued, aloud. “If you can make my
girls half as <i>distingué</i> as you are yourself in full dress,
or home-dress either, for that matter, I shall be satisfied.
I always told you you were a genius in your profession—creative,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
not merely imitative genius. It was
a shame that you did not give others the benefit of it
before now. It is refreshing to one who has cultivated
any taste for the æsthetic, to look about your rooms.
I have lively hopes that dress may be understood and
studied as one of the fine arts among us in time. You
will be known in this generation and region, at least,
as a benefactress. We go into another room to be
measured, did you say?”</p>

<p>She swept her daughters before her into the fitting-room,
and a buzz and rustle succeeded the silence her
entrance had caused.</p>

<p>In Blanche’s hearing no one could comment openly
upon what had passed. But there were significant
whispers and wondering looks, and by the time the
gossips reached the street, much and prolonged discussion
with regard to this episode in the history of “opening
day.”</p>

<p>For the eccentric old lady who could afford to defy
the dictate of SOCIETY, and exercised her right, was
Mrs. Horatio Harding, whose own veins were full of
old, rich Dutch blood, and whose husband was a merchant
prince, and Mr. Harding Walford was her
nephew-in-law. If she had set her mind upon making
the Hiller girls the fashion, she had carried her point
triumphantly. With a sort of insolent grace, perhaps,
at which people grumbled while they obeyed her, but
she had had her way, as usual. Mrs. Horatio Harding
had “opinions,” and it was not always safe or pleasant
to oppose her.</p>

<p>“You may not know that you have done us a great
service—one for which we can never pay you aright,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
said Imogen to her at the close of “the season’s” work.
“But you have! That we have succeeded beyond our
most sanguine expectations is due, in a large measure,
to the foothold you gave us that first day. If other
women who have as much influence would use it to
free, not enslave, their sex; to overcome, instead of
strengthening the prejudices that bear so hardly upon
us already, what a change would be wrought in homes
where the few strive and toil, and the many are served!”</p>

<p>The strong white hand with the glittering <i>solitaire</i>,
was raised threateningly.</p>

<p>“What did I tell you? I will not be praised for doing
a simple act of justice, especially when my heart, as
well as my conscience, moved me to it. And <i>you</i>, my
sweet child, may not know that you have had a narrow
escape from marrying a man who has proved himself
no more worthy to mate with you than am I with one of
the holy men of old—those of whom the world was not
worthy. But you have. That is all I shall ever <i>say</i> on
the subject. But I think the more for my reserve when
with you. And Harding Walford knows that I do. I
am not reticent in his hearing. Don’t attempt to defend
him! He has lost <i>you</i>, and that ought to be punishment
enough for one who is capable of appreciating you.
Not that he ever was.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want him to be punished, dear Mrs. Harding,”
replied Imogen, gently. “He only swam with
the tide.”</p>

<p>“Precisely! and to deserve such a wife as you would
make, a man ought to be strong of soul and right of
purpose. Don’t talk to me about moral cowards! I
think I was born hating them!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>

<p>Two years later, this steady friend dropped in to see
the sisters on a gloomy afternoon in February. The
light from the front windows made long, clean cuts in
the clinging yellow fog without, across the rimy pavement
to the carriage, with its liveried coachman and
fine horses. Passers-by, on their way to humble homes,
lifted eyelids beaded with the icy damp, and thought
how lucky were the dwellers in the stately house; how
much-to-be envied the guest who rode in state above the
mire of the common ways. Those who recognized the
liveries, and knew whose was the dwelling, pondered,
more or less wonderingly, upon the incongruity of the
unabated intimacy, and speculated, perhaps, upon the
probabilities that the Harding pride would have revolted
at a matrimonial alliance between a scion of
their house and one of the “reduced” family, for all
Mrs. Horatio’s show of friendship. It was a lucky
thing, decided eight out of ten of those who considered
the matter, that young Walford had not committed
himself irrevocably before the “misfortune”
that showed him how near he was to the edge of
the abyss. He had made a desirable match last fall,
and was now travelling in Europe with his heiress
bride.</p>

<p>Little cared guest or hostesses what the outside world
thought or believed respecting their intercourse. Emma’s
boys were building block houses on the back parlor
floor. The three sisters were gathered about the centre-table
in the other room, talking in low voices over their
work. Mrs. Harding stopped in the doorway on seeing
their grave faces, and that they were making black
<i>crêpe</i> bonnets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span></p>

<p>“A mourning order!” she said, in her unceremonious
way. “Anybody that I know?”</p>

<p>“Not an order exactly,” explained Imogen, when
they had welcomed her. “But poor Mr. Sibthorpe has
gone at last, and Blanche proposed that we should
spare the widow and three unmarried daughters the
expense of bonnets and veils; so we are making them
and the widow’s caps out of work hours. We do our
charity work at such odd times you know—and together.</p>

<p>“You are the Blessed Three Sisters—<i>that</i> everybody
knows!” uttered the visitor. “I don’t believe I <i>could</i>
set a stitch for that tribe of lazy locusts! Amelia, the
married one, is no better. Her husband failed awhile
ago, as you may remember, and she is too proud to
help him in the small haberdasher’s shop he has lately
set up; sits at home like a—I won’t say lady—but an
idiotic automaton—”</p>

<p>“Who ever heard of an intellectual one?” laughed
Blanche.</p>

<p>“No pertness, miss! I don’t pick my terms when I
am excited. She sits in the small parlor over the
store, as I was saying, and curries favor with wealthy
and charitable ladies by cutting sponge and velvet into
monkey and black-and-tan terrier pen-wipers for fancy
fairs. What are the Sibthorpe’s going to do, now that
the man they murdered among them is dead?”</p>

<p>“His life was insured”—began Emma.</p>

<p>“Humph!” interrupted Mrs. Harding. “You
needn’t proceed. They will eat the insurance up to
the last dollar, and by that time the boys will be big
enough to divide the women among them; to carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
them bodily—their expenses, that is—as we see ants
running about with egg sacs bigger than themselves on
their shoulders. I know the old, hideous story by
heart. Drop the subject.”</p>

<p>“Let me give you a piece of news that will entertain
you better,” said Blanche, merrily. “One of the
Payne girls—Sophia, the youngest—is going to marry
a widower with eight children—all at home.”</p>

<p>“Serves her right! But I am sorry for the children.
Go on!”</p>

<p>“The happy man is a Mr. Gregorias, of Spanish extraction.
He is small and withered, and reported to
be rich as cream. So Arethusa says. The wedding
dress is to be of white satin, with point lace veil and
flounces—the gift of the groom.”</p>

<p>“Have you undertaken the trousseau?” queried
Mrs. Harding, fixing her keen gaze upon Imogen.</p>

<p>“No,” she answered, coloring as she smiled. “I
have declined making any engagements for the spring.
I am going abroad for a year in May, and Blanche does
not want a stranger here in my place.”</p>

<p>“Markham Burke <i>is</i> the man, then! My love! I
congratulate you with all my heart. I have been on
thorns all winter about you and the noble fellow. I
was afraid you had some Quixotic notions that would
stand in the way of his happiness and yours.”</p>

<p>“No; why should I have?” rejoined the <i>fiancée</i>,
speaking quietly and sensibly. “We are not vowed to
our trades, or to celibacy. Markham says there is no
need that he, with his ample means, should let me keep
up my business. Whatever I have made, he insists
upon settling upon me. He would have had me divide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
it all between Blanche and Emma, but they would not
allow it.”</p>

<p>“I should hope not!” cried Blanche, energetically.
“Two women who can take care of themselves!’”</p>

<p>“Blanche will enlarge her department,” continued
Imogen, “now that I will leave her room. You should
hear her plans of making a temple of art—not of
fashion alone—in these two parlors. It will be very
beautiful. She can afford to indulge her taste in these
respects. She is making money.”</p>

<p>“Means to be a nabob-ess before she dies—or marries,”
interjected the youngest sister.</p>

<p>“You are a mercenary witch,” said Mrs. Harding.
“Emma, Mr. Harding says your lots are rising in value
fast, and the price of land in that quarter of the city
is sure to increase with tenfold rapidity during the
next dozen years. He would not advise you to close
with the offer made you last week, unless you need the
money.”</p>

<p>“Thank you and him!” replied the young widow.
“I am not anxious to sell. Let it grow for the boys.
It belongs to them. The rest of us are provided for.
Even for mamma there is enough and to spare. We
have never been tempted by the various straits of
poverty and shabby gentility to wish for our father’s
death, that we might profit by <i>his</i> life-insurance policy.
Feeble as he is, his cheerfulness, his patience and affection
for us all, make his a very bright presence in
our home. It is a priceless comfort to us all that he
is not compelled, when he needs them most, to relinquish
the home and luxuries he toiled so long and
bravely to obtain for us.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span></p>

<p>“You can’t imagine what pride and delight he takes
in the boys!” exclaimed Blanche. “We really hope
he may live to see them grown.”</p>

<p>“It is the story of the old storks and their young, to
the life,” said Mrs. Harding to her husband that night.
“I used to think it a fable. I believe now that it is
true, out and out!”</p>

<b>CRITICAL NOTICES.</b></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘Roxy’ may be accepted as the latest example of a purely American novel, and to
say the least, one of the very best.”—<i>New York Tribune.</i></p>

<p>“In this novel Mr. Eggleston’s powers appear at their best and amplest, and he has
accomplished the by no means easy task of excelling himself.”—<i>Boston Journal.</i></p>

<p>“There can be no doubt whatever that ‘Roxy’ is the best product of Dr. Eggleston’s
activity in the field of fiction.”—<i>New York Eve. Post.</i></p>

<p>“As a pure, but vigorous American romance, Mr. Eggleston’s new work is better
even than his ‘Hoosier Schoolmaster’ and ‘Circuit Rider.’”—<i>Phila. Eve. Bulletin.</i></p>

<p>“It strengthens the author’s position as a writer who has brought new life and a
decided manliness into our native fiction.”—<i>Boston Courier.</i></p>

<p>“‘Roxy,’ a story whose purport and power are much deeper than the author has
before reached.”—<i>Springfield Republican.</i></p>

<p>“The story is powerfully told, and if Mr. Eggleston had written nothing else, ‘Roxy’
would place him in a foremost position among American authors.”—<i>N. Y. Commercial
Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>“Its pictures of Western life are vivid, and throughout betray the hand of a master
in literature and fiction.”—<i>Episcopal Register.</i></p>

<p>“As a faithful picture of American life, it ranks far above any novel published in the
United States during the past twenty years.”—<i>Brooklyn Times.</i></p>

<p>“We advise our readers to buy and read ‘Roxy.’ They will find the plot deeply
interesting, and will gather from it not only transient pleasure, but permanent good.”—<i>Louisville
Post.</i></p>

<p>“The story of ‘Roxy’ is Dr. Eggleston’s best work. It attains a higher merit than
his other works in epic purpose as well as a dramatic form.”—<i>The Methodist.</i></p>

<p>“Buy the book and read it, as it is well worth the time spent to do it.”—<i>Washington
Chronicle.</i></p></div>

<p>“<i>To those who love a pure diction, a healthful tone, and thought that leads up
to the higher and better aims, that gives brighter color to some of the hard, dull phases
of life, that awakens the mind to renewed activity, and makes one mentally better,
the prose and poetical works of Dr. Holland will prove an ever new, ever welcome
source from which to draw.</i>”—<span class="smcap">New Haven Palladium.</span></p></div>

<p>Messrs. <span class="smcap">Charles Scribner’s Sons</span> have now completed the issue of
a New Edition of Dr. Holland’s Writings, printed from new plates, in a very
attractive style, in artistic binding, and at a greatly reduced price.</p>

<p>It is believed that the aggregate sale of Dr. Holland’s Books, amounting
as it does to half a million volumes, exceeds the circulation of the writings of
any other American author. There is not a single book of his which has not
had an unquestionable success, and most of them have been in such constant
and increasing demand that the plates were actually worn out.</p>

<p>“<i>Dr. Holland will always find a congenial audience in the homes of culture and
refinement. He does not affect the play of the darker and fiercer passions, but delights
in the sweet images that cluster around the domestic hearth. He cherishes a
strong fellow-feeling with the pure and tranquil life in the modest social circles of
the American people, and has thus won his way to the companionship of many
friendly hearts.</i>”—<span class="smcap">N. Y. Tribune.</span></p>
